# **Foreword**

It was almost 15 years ago when, as a newly married college athlete, I first
got the itch to start my own company. I didn’t know anything, except that I
wanted to make some money. As I began studying, I started to discover all
of the things that were essential to success.

Creating a great product, building a funnel, driving traffic, building a
list and . . . writing copy.

As I learned about each of these aspects of growing an online company,
I got excited about all of them, except writing copy.

I didn’t enjoy writing in college, and honestly, I wasn’t very good at it
either.

So, despite what people told me, I focused on EVERYTHING except
the copy.

I would create a new product that was much better than my
competitors, yet I was confused when they would consistently outsell me.

I had a better product. Why weren’t people buying MINE instead of
THEIRS?

As idea after idea flopped, I started to realize that it wasn’t the product
that made a company successful. It was that company’s ability to create a
strong enough desire for that product that the customer would do anything
to buy it.

AKA Sales Copywriting.
That was the key.
Eventually, I gave in and started to study good copy.
I wanted— I NEEDED— to understand the psychology behind why
people buy.

The more I studied, the more I started to notice the patterns that existed
in all successful marketing campaigns, and learned how to model them for
the things I was selling.

As I made the shift and started to master copywriting, I noticed
something very interesting . . .

Creating a great product didn’t make me rich.
Building an amazing funnel didn’t make me rich.
Driving traffic didn’t make me rich.
Building a list didn’t make me rich.
Until I learned how to write good copy, none of those things mattered
because the products I tried to sell didn’t sell. The traffic I tried to drive
didn’t convert. The funnels I built didn’t persuade people to buy what I


9


was selling.

Copywriting is what made me rich.
It is the great amplifier.
It has more impact on how much money you make with your company
than anything else.

Jim Edwards became a partner of mine a few years ago when he looked
at the mission we had with ClickFunnels: to help free all entrepreneurs. He
called me one day and asked, “Do you want to know how you can make
ALL of your customers MORE successful?”

I asked him how and he responded, “You need to help them write better
copy. When their copy improves, they will sell more stuff through their
funnels, and they’ll stay with ClickFunnels forever.”

With that as an idea, he created a powerful tool for our community
called _Funnel Scripts_ that has helped thousands of entrepreneurs to write
copy at the push of a button . . . even if they have NO IDEA what they are
doing. I’ve watched as this tool has helped people who have NEVER had
success online to finally generate leads, make money, and find success.

When he started on this book last year, he told me that his goal was to
help more people to master copywriting. That was a mighty tall order, but
if anyone could, I knew Jim would.

In the right hands, this book will help you to make more money, serve
more people, and increase your impact so you can change the world in

your own way.

Few people on earth have studied and applied copy in more situations,
for more people, and in more businesses than Jim has. This book will teach
you a skill that will pay you for the rest of your life.

Don’t do what I did and wait to master the art of putting words on
paper and on screen to persuade people to buy from you. Throw yourself
in 100%, because it’s the most important skill you can learn during this
life.

# **Introduction**

_“I have always believed that writing advertisements is the second most profitable_

_form of writing. The first, of course, is ransom notes.”_

_Philip Dusenberry_


Nobody is born knowing how to sell.

I got started selling after I graduated from college. I quit or got fired
from seven different jobs in the first eighteen months out of school. All
those jobs revolved around commissioned sales. Initially, I was miserable
trying to sell life insurance. I sold discount club memberships. I sold cell
phones. I sold “trunked” radios (a precursor to cell phones). I sold weight
loss.

I even tried pre-selling gravesites (which meant trying to sell grave
plots door-to-door in Hampton, VA to people who weren’t dead yet).

You name it; I tried selling it.
Everything culminated when I became a mortgage broker after I made a
sale to a lady while working for a weight loss company. I sold her the
weight loss program and she said, “You know, you’d be terrific in my
business.” I thought to myself, “Well, heck, I’ve been in every other
business, so let me see what she’s doing.” She told me about the mortgage
business and I said, “Well, okay,” that’s selling something people want
and need. People need money when they want a mortgage. Turns out you
don’t have to work too hard to sell them money they need because they
need that to buy a house.

I decided to give it a try and quickly learned that selling wasn’t the hard
part, getting in front of the people at the right time was. That’s when I first
got exposed to sales copywriting in the form of writing ads and scripts that
I used to call people on the phone and ask them if they wanted to
refinance.

That was the start of it. Later, I created a program on how to not get
ripped off when you got a mortgage (because I’d seen a lot of people
ripped off by mortgage brokers). I also wrote a book on how to sell your
house yourself. When I put those products online in 1997, I learned about
what we think of now as sales copy and sales copywriting as far as sales
letters, email teasers and direct mail.

Once I decided to get good at writing sales copy, I did find some
training. Somehow, I got my hands on a course by a guy named Marlon
Sanders. I listened to recordings of him explaining the different parts of a


11


sales letter. That’s when it clicked with me that copywriting isn’t just
putting down words on paper and hoping that it works.

### **Copywriting is about structure and strategy.**


I started reading books on the subject, including _Scientific Advertising_
by Claude Hopkins. It’s a short book, but it hits the highlights we need to
know and remember. Though it helps to read people’s books (obviously),
one of the best things you can do is read any sales message that gets you to
spend money. _That_ is copy you should study because you’ve connected
with it on an emotional level. We’ll talk more about this later.

One thing to note: To my recollection, I have never written sales copy
for anybody else, only for my products. I realized early on that nobody
could sell my stuff better than I could. Also, when I first started selling
online, I couldn’t afford to hire somebody to write a sales letter for me, so
I had to learn how to do it myself. The first website I ever launched had
something like twenty pages. I had no clue what I was doing. Then I was
exposed to the idea of a long-form, one-page sales letter, where people
came and scrolled down a single page with a giant sales pitch.

So, I converted that 20-page website to a one-page sales letter. Now, if
you printed it out, it might have been ten pages long, but it was one page
on the website. Overnight, my sales went up 250%. That’s when it clicked
with me that, “Hey, if you want to make more money, writing good sales
copy is the key!” It didn’t have anything to do with getting more traffic. It
had everything to do with how well I was able to make my sales pitch over
the web.

Over the years, I’ve written sales letters that have done over three
million dollars in sales; another one did two and a half million; another
one did over a million and a half selling a $29 product. By the way, you’ve
got to sell a lot of stuff at $29 a pop to make a million and a half bucks.

### **Here’s the big thing to remember: nobody will write better** **copy for your stuff than you.**


You want to be the one that creates your copy (or at least edits it) if at
all possible because you’re the one who knows how to connect with your
audience.

### **It takes time to learn how to write copy from scratch . . . but**


12


### **it’s worth it!**

The cool thing is nobody is born a million-dollar copywriter. Nobody is
born knowing the exact words to use for sales copy. But, unlike a fiction
writer or even a non-fiction writer, sales copy follows patterns you can
learn. You can use and adapt those proven patterns to quickly create copy
that sells. It’s the fastest type of writing you can learn and it’s also the
most profitable.

# **Secret #1** **What Is Copywriting?**

_Sales copywriting is anything intended to persuade the right reader, viewer, or_

_listener to take a specific action._

_Jim Edwards_


Here’s my definition of copywriting:


_**Sales copywriting is anything intended to persuade the right reader, viewer, or**_

_**listener to take**_
_**a specific action.**_

_**Jim Edwards**_


Take a moment to think about this. You want your reader, viewer, or
listener to take a specific action.

Whether online or offline, these specific actions you want them to take
include clicking a link, making an inquiry for more information, buying
something, or going on to the next step in your sales process. With sales
copy, you’re trying to get somebody to click a buy button, fill out a form,
buy something online, or through the mail. Maybe you want them to pick


14


up the phone and dial a phone number or go to a physical location such as
a store. When thinking about sales copy, this is true 99 times out of 100.

Sales copy can include anything from three-line newspaper ads to 40page sales letters posted on the web. Thirty-minute infomercial videos,
Facebook posts, Instagram posts, and anything in between can and should
be considered sales copy.

If you want to get good at sales copy, you’re saying you want to get
good at enticing people to click links, fill out forms and spend money. By
the way, that is a good thing to get good at! However, you don’t want to
over-complicate it. Most people see copywriting as a complicated thing
that takes years to master and decades to get a handle on. They make it this
big, complicated mess in their head. The bottom line is sales copy is
anything you put in front of people to get them to click stuff, fill out forms
and spend money.

When you think about sales copy that way, it becomes less daunting.
This is not rocket science!

### **What makes copywriting different from regular writing?**


Less than you think. Most people believe copywriting is a different way
of thinking and writing. It’s very distinct with specific patterns. Sometimes
these people are right. Other times they’re completely wrong.

From my experience, the best copywriting occurs when people don’t
realize it’s copy because it’s interesting to them. I used to read sales letters
that came in the mail otherwise known as “free reports.” It’s funny to think
that back in the day, you would request a free report. It was nothing but a
10, 20, or 30-page sales letter. Because it was on a topic that interested
you, you didn’t see it as sales copy. You saw it as a free report.

When people are interested, they’re going to read it and not think about
the fact that it’s trying to sell them something. Now, what makes people
pay attention? What makes people read and not think about the sales
message? Your content addresses their fears. It speaks to their desires. It
uses the words they use. It feels like a conversation with a friend or a
trusted advisor.

I think a lot of people also believe sales copy is something that
magically makes people do what they wouldn’t ordinarily want to do. The
reality is that people love to buy stuff.

That’s why everybody has hellacious credit card bills. That’s why
everybody has made Amazon the number one site in the world to buy
stuff. People love to buy. Like the old axiom says, “people love to buy;


15


they hate to be sold.” People buy when they feel like something will make
them feel better or help them get what they want. Because it uses familiar,
comfortable words. Again, sales copy is like a conversation with a friend
or a trusted advisor.

### **Copywriting comes down to intention.**


What do I want someone to do as a result of reading, watching, or
listening to what I’ve created? With that in mind, sales copy can be a
tweet. It can be an article. It could be a content video. It could be a
Facebook Live video. It can be a meme. It can be anything you put in front
of a targeted prospect. You put value in front of them. Then you invite
them to take the next step which is to buy the stuff they want to buy

anyway.

### **How much has the art or science of copywriting changed** **over the years?**


The graphic below is a reprint of the 1900 sales catalog from Sears and


16


Roebuck. It was reprinted actually in 1970. That’s why it says $3.95 on it.


People have been buying stuff since people invented money. Before
that, people bartered.

The way people talk has changed, maybe not for the better. Formal
words people use and the way they address one another have changed. I’ll
make a little side comment here that I think people used to be a little bit
more respectful of people’s feelings and perspectives. Not in all cases, but
people had manners. Today, if you go to the mall and listen to a bunch of
teenagers hanging out in front of various stores, you will see that manners
have escaped many. Enough on my little side rant there.

The way people talk has changed. They don’t talk the same. People


17


have the same amount of time as they did 200 years ago, but they have a
hundred more things fighting for their attention like social media, regular
mail, TV, radio, communication devices like text, Instant Messenger and
cell phones. These things compete for a finite amount of a person’s
attention span. That’s why, at the end of the day when you are drained,
you say things like, “I’m done.”

It’s not that people are stupid or lazy. It’s not that people have become
dumber. People have more things fighting for their attention. It’s important
to understand this with your copy. In today’s world you must use a lot
more curiosity to stop people in their tracks and get them to pay attention
to you. Also, there’s a lot less buildup before you must get to the point.

My next-door neighbor is an old southern guy, super cool dude. He’s a
builder who built my house. He is old-school. When you talk with him,
before you can get down to business, you have to do 20-minutes of
warmup. Hey, how’s the family? What’s going on? Talk about the
weather, talk about politics, talk about the neighborhood, talk about this,
talk about that. Then at some point there’s this deep breath. Then, what are
we going to do here in this particular area?

That’s the way people used to be. People aren’t that way anymore.
When it comes to copywriting, you’ve got to dispense with a lot of the
warm-up. Instead, you grab them, get their attention with curiosity, and
then drive them to the point you’re trying to make.

### **How has copywriting stayed the same?**


People are people who want to buy. You must have the attitude that if
people understand the benefit of your product, service or software, they’re
going to buy it. It’s your job as the person creating the copy to be a great
communicator about why they need what you have. It’s your
responsibility.

People have hopes, fears and dreams. They’ve always had hopes, fears
and dreams, and they will continue to have hopes, fears and dreams. They
love things. They hate things. They have opinions. The better you
understand the people in your niche market, the more money you’ll make
and the happier they’re going to be because your can communicate better
with them.

### **Understand your niche audience.**


18


Let’s talk about your niche. When people talk about copywriting,
writing ads and targeting, they talk about their niche. But, most people talk
about numbers. They speak of psychographics or demographics. Often,
they forget that **people** in the niche actually **are** the niche. You need to
understand the people. It’s good to know the numbers and all that other
stuff, but you need to understand the people, the person, the individuals in
your niche. When we talk about your avatar, we will talk about your ideal
person, whom I like to call FRED.

Understand these are people with hopes, dreams and worries. They are
just like you. They want time off. They want to take care of their children.
They worry about the future. They stress out over their credit card bills.
They want to have a nice car. They want to provide a great future for their
family. All these things are important to them. You need to know what’s
important to them because you’re selling to people. You’re not selling to a
niche.

### **In copywriting, there’s no prize for second place.**


Your copy either works or you starve. That was kind of like a smack in
the mouth. You don’t make money when someone says, “Hey, great sales
letter. Hey, I loved your video.” It’s nice to hear, but unfortunately, that
doesn’t spend. You make money when you’re the one who gets people to
click, buy and opt-in. That’s it.

You don’t go halfway with your copy. You don’t do something just to
see what happens and maybe it’ll work out. No. You put forth a strong
effort every single time. There are tools like Funnel Scripts that can help.
There are tools like my wizards that can help you. The bottom line is
you’ve got to be serious about this. You can’t just do it half-assed.
Because if you do, you’re going to get a half-assed result.


Summary:

People love to buy. Sales copy helps them buy from you!


The words may have changed, but the intention of copywriting has

not.


Hopes, fears, dreams, and desire motivate people to buy.


Anyone can get good at sales copy . . . you just need to practice.

# **Secret #2** **One Man’s Journey With Sales Copy**

_“The secret of all effective advertising is not the creation of new and tricky words_

_and pictures, but one of putting familiar words and pictures into new_

_relationships.”_

_Leo Burnett_


I do not consider myself a professional copywriter because I do not write
copy for other people. I create professional level copy to sell my own stuff.
That’s the difference.

Nobody is born writing sales copy except maybe Ron Popeil, the dude
who did the Pocket Fisherman, the Showtime Rotisserie, and the Inside the
Egg Scrambler. His ability to create offers, write copy and invent products
is unmatched. You and I were not born knowing how to write sales copy.
The great news is you can learn.

In the early years, I designed flyers for my college fraternity parties.
The pressure was on because if people didn’t show up to the parties, I
would lose my job as the social chairman along with the privileges.

When I worked for the mortgage banks, I wrote their ads. Every week
my branch manager asked me to write an ad. I had to have it to her by
Wednesday so she could send it over to the compliance department so it
could run on the weekend. The ads were pretty good. But the bank rarely
ran the ads exactly the way I did them because the compliance department


20


hated me. I wanted to use words that weren’t good to use in bank ads
because they made the regulators nervous. It was one of the reasons why I
stopped working for the bank.

Finally, the head of the compliance department called, “Look, we can
tell when Jim’s writing the ads and when somebody else is writing the ads.
You might as well stop sending us Jim’s ads because we’re not going to
run them.” Because there were so many laws about what you could and
could not say, these people were gun shy of anything that looked like
exciting sales copy. It was an inauspicious beginning.

I started selling online in 1997 with decent results. At the time I started
selling online, I was bankrupt and living in a trailer park (after some
terrible business decisions). Here’s the thing, you can’t learn how to make
great decisions until you make bad decisions, right? I wasn’t setting the
world on fire, but I was making money.

Then, in the fall of 2000, I realized that something had to change to get
out of that trailer park where I’d been for six years. My ability to persuade
people to buy from me had to improve. To do that, I had to run better ads,
write more compelling copy for the web, and get seriously good at putting
words on paper to encourage people to buy.

It was a conscious decision to do whatever it took. I was sitting in the
tiny office in our spare bedroom. From that moment, I became a serious
student of sales copy. I read all the classics I could get my hands on
including _Scientific Advertising_ and _My Life in Advertising_ . You will find
my recommended reading list in the appendix.

I started writing and testing copy everywhere I could. Some were for
my products, but I also wrote some for a few real estate agents. I’d put
something up, watch what happened, and often nothing would happen.
When something good did happen, instead of chalking it up to luck, I
studied what worked, kept doing that, stopped doing what didn’t work, and
never quit examining the good copy.


21


During the summer of 2000, I went to work for a company where I
wrote a sales letter to sell a $97 CD-ROM. Here’s a picture of it. As part of
this project, I figured out how to create the auto-run CD and do the screen
capture video which in 2000 was a huge deal. The sales letter made
$100,000 for the company in three months, a big deal to the company.

I figured out how to create a six-figure sales funnel for this guy in less
than ninety days. My wife and I moved out of the trailer, bought our little
house and then he fired me in June of 2001. I’ll never forget that Friday in
June. With a new home complete with payments, no job and my fledgling
ability to write sales copy, I was scared. I’ll never forget what my wife
said when I arrived home, “You basically have 30 days to make this work.
By the way, if you could just make a third of what you made for him, we’ll
be fine.”

This guy paid me $1,500 a month ($18,000 per year). That’s where my
self-worth was at this point. I was making 1,500 bucks a month, created a
six-figure funnel for this guy and then he fired me. Over the next few
weeks, I wrote or co-wrote three different sales letters. In the last four
months of 2001, I made more money than I made the previous four years
combined. We ended up paying off the little house in eighteen months.

That’s the power of knowing how to write great sales copy. Sales copy
changed my life and it can change your life too.

This picture shows our current home (from the back).


22


I love the picture of it in the winter. The reason I love this so much is
that our little trailer was so cold, I would sit in that back-office bedroom
with two chihuahuas on my lap to keep me warm. I would sit there and
work on my computer and never give up on my dream of making all of
this stuff work.

I am living proof that learning how to write good sales copy can change
your life no matter where you are.


Summary:

Nobody is born knowing how to write sales copy.


Learning to write great copy can change your life.


Read the classics like _Scientific Advertising_ .


Commit to developing your skills with copywriting.

# **Secret #3** **Without A Strong Why, People Don’t Buy**

_People don’t buy without a reason why._

_Jim Edwards_


This is the single most valuable secret I ever learned. In my opinion, this is
the one that can change your life the fastest.

Burn this into your brain. _People don’t buy without a reason why._ Say
it with me, “ _People don’t buy without a reason why_ .”

### **There are ten reasons people buy.**


Are there other reasons? Maybe. Honestly, I’ve only focused on the
first five reasons why people buy. When I learned this, it changed my life.
The lightbulb went off. My brain expanded. I knew how to frame my
messages to people for why they should buy, and how to tie my product to

_reasons_
their why. I now had pegs on which to hang for people to buy.

Most people who create sales copy give prospects one reason to buy
now. Usually, it involves saving or making money. That’s it. It can be
about making money for some people, but it’s not all about making money
for everyone. These ten reasons why people buy gave me a one, two, three,
four punch and more in my copy.

Here are the ten reasons. We’ll talk about how you put them into
practice quickly in your copy. People will buy because they want to:


Make money


Save money


Save time


24


Avoid effort


Escape mental or physical pain


Get more comfort


Achieve greater cleanliness or hygiene to attain
better health


Gain praise


Feel more loved


Increase their popularity or social status


The first five—make money, save money, save
time, avoid effort, escape pain—resonated with me so
well I committed them to memory. Those are the pegs
people use to justify their buying. These are their
why.

The key here is to tie multiple reasons to why
people buy, not just one. Think about it this way: it’s
like tying down a tarp in a windstorm. If you tie down
one corner of it, it’s going to blow all over the place and not be under
control. But, if you tie it in two, three, four, or five locations, suddenly it’s
right where you want it. You do this by asking certain types of questions
about your product and getting creative with the answers.

### **Questions you can ask about your product.**


You might think this sounds like work. However, putting in a little
brain sweat now can translate into millions of dollars down the road. It’s a
fun exercise to do. Here are the questions:


1. What are five ways my product or service will help them make

money?


2. How can I or my product or service help them save money over the

next week, month, or year?


3. How much time can I save them and what else could they do with that

time?


4. What is something they don’t have to do anymore once they get my

product or service? (This is how you figure out how it helps them


25


avoid effort.)


5. What physical pain do I eliminate for them and what does that mean

for their life and business?


6. How does my product or service eliminate mental pain or worry for

them?


7. What are three ways I or my product can help them feel more

comfortable?


8. How does my product or service make it easier for them to achieve

greater cleanliness or hygiene?


9. How does my product or service help them feel more healthy or more

alive?


10. What are three ways my product or service is going to help them be

the envy of their friends and feel more loved by their family?


11. How will buying my product make them feel more popular and

increase their social status?


If you take each of those questions and ask it honestly . . . anticipating
an answer, you will be amazed at the results. Now, here’s how to put this
on steroids. Force yourself to come up with ten answers to each of those
questions. Your brain immediately exploded at this thought, didn’t it? I
learned a problem-solving technique from a mentor of mine years ago. He
said, “Take the problem you’re trying to solve and write it at the top of a
piece of paper. Then write solutions to fill up the entire piece of paper.
Then go to the next page and fill that page up.”

The easy answers come in the first third of the page. Then once you’ve
exhausted the easy solutions, you need to dig in and start solving your
problem and thinking outside the box. It’s those answers that come later in
the process that contain the real solution. If you answer each question even
five times, you’ll see answers that aren’t obvious.

Once you go beyond those two, three, four easy answers to each
question, you start digging in and thinking about who your target audience
is, what they want and where they are in their life. That’s where you’re
going to come up with copy bullets that once you write them, you’re going
to think, “Oh my gosh. That’s awesome. That’s going to make a huge
difference.”

I want to challenge you to take this list of questions and answer each of
them multiple times. You’ll come up with answers that will make a huge


26


difference in your ability to sell.

### **How do you use this secret? How do you use this list?**


You can tie these reasons to your offers, to your headlines, to your
stories, to your bullets, to your content topics, to your calls to action, to
everything. It’s a lens through which everything gets focused. It’s all based
on that. Because once you understand the why or the whys, you can tie
stuff to it that you wouldn’t ordinarily, and your competitors don’t.

### **Here are a few examples.**


1. **Protein Shake** . How could we apply the ten reasons people buy to a

protein shake? _Make money:_ Drink this protein shake in the morning
and you will have a fantastic amount of energy. You will do better at
your job and probably get a raise.
_Save money_ : Our protein shake is 25% less expensive than the market
leader, but it has superior ingredients.
_Save time_ : With our protein shake, you can have a nutritious breakfast
in 30 seconds. You can spend more time with your kids before
rushing out the door. This reason also ties in with _feel more love_ .
_Avoid effort:_ You have your breakfast made in 30 seconds and it’s
delicious.
_Escape physical or mental pain_ : Don’t you hate feeling bloated all the
time when you eat too much breakfast? Or, what about feeling like
you’re starving because you skipped breakfast? This shake solves that
problem for you.
_Get more comfort_ : I don’t know how this would help you get more
comfortable unless it helped with constipation.
_Achieve greater cleanliness or hygiene and better health_ : When you
drink this protein shake, you won’t have bad breath when you show
up at the office. Drinking this protein shake every morning is proven
to help you lose weight and look great in your jeans.
_Gain praise and feel more loved_ : You save time in the morning that
you can spend with your family.
_Be popular or increase social status_ : You lose weight. You look
great. Think of all the new friends you’re going to make.


2. .
**Executive coaching program** . It’s easy to tie it to _making money_

_Make money:_ Whatever you’re teaching a person will help them do


27


better in their job, get a promotion, or get recruited by another

company.
_Save money_ : You could spend twice as much on consultants to help
you do this, but we’re going to teach you how to do it.
_Avoid effort_ : You don’t have to figure this stuff out on your own. All
you have to do is do what we tell you to do using our proven
templates and you’re good to go.
_Escape physical or mental pain_ : What could an executive who’s
looking to do executive coaching be trying to do that would cause
physical or mental pain? Spending too much time at the office and
neglecting their family. Interesting how we tie mental pain to love
and familial status. Where are they feeling pain mentally or
physically? When they’re spending too much time at the office and
not able to spend time with their family and Little Timmy’s starting to
call the UPS guy “daddy.” That would suck.
_Get more comfort_ : Attend our executive coaching program where the
top 1% of achievers enjoy all the benefits of having that corner office
at a Fortune 500 company.
_Attain fuller health_ : We’re going to show you not only how to excel
in your job, but also how to find balance in your life once and for all.
You can manage your health and energy to be even more of a high
performer.
_Gain praise and feel more loved_ : We’ll show you how to organize
your time, so you are not staying at the office until ten every night.
You’ll be able to go home and keep little Timmy from calling the
UPS guy “daddy.”


3. .
**Dog training book**

_Save money_ : I would start here. Learn how to train your dog yourself
and avoid paying $50 an hour to somebody who probably isn’t a
certified professional.
_Avoid effort, escape pain_ : Avoid the issue of dealing with a dog bite
either to yourself or a neighbor. Now, you could amp that up. Escape
the potential pain of a lawsuit if your dog bites somebody. Don’t get
sued. This book will help you to train your dog correctly and control
aggression. “Oh, dang, I better buy that because I don’t want to lose
my house because little Fluffy bit the neighbor’s kid.”
You can apply these reasons why to anything. Once you understand
the reasons why, your job is simply to tie as many of them as you can
to your product, service, software, or whatever it is. You must
identify the reasons why people buy your stuff, specifically more than


28


the obvious ones everybody else uses. You need to tie your product to
as many reasons why as you can. Get creative. Get silly. Get inspired.
Do something that relaxes you and let your mind run wild.


You might write down fifty or a hundred different things. If you find
that one angle, that one unique why nobody else is using that makes all the
difference in the world, or catches their attention, that’s where
understanding these ten reasons why people buy can transform your
copywriting and mindset forever.


Summary:

Commit these ten reasons why people buy to memory.


Use as many of them as you can in your copy to “tie down” the
prospect.


Don’t fall into the trap of always making it about making or saving

money.


Get creative in how you use these reasons . . . make yourself stretch!


29


# **Secret #4** **Nobody Cares About You In Your Sales Copy**

_“People aren’t interested in you. They’re interested in themselves.”_

_Dale Carnegie_


People don’t care about you; they only care about themselves.

That may sound harsh. You’re probably thinking, “Oh Jim, that sounds
kind of mean. My customers love me. Everybody likes me. That’s not true;
they do care about me.”

Nope.
They don’t care about you. Seriously, they don’t. Think about when
you buy stuff or pay money. What do you care about? Be honest. You care
about getting your money’s worth. You care about getting what was
promised. You care about getting it when you want it. You care about it
meeting your needs. You care about all the things related to the product
and how it impacts you.

What don’t you care about? The salesperson’s kids. You don’t care that
they’re having a bad day. You don’t care about anything except whether
you’re going to get what you’re supposed to get. I know this sounds harsh,


30


but it’s true. I’m sure there’s a unicorn out there that is empathetic towards
you and what’s going on in your life and wants to know what’s happening
and how they can help you before they give you money, but they are the
vast minority.

Here’s a technique I’ve learned to help you make your copy all about
them. It’s a shortcut, a hack.

Look for these words in your copy:


_**“I, me, my, we, ours.”**_


Why do you want to look for those words? Those words show where
you’re talking about yourself. These are the words your prospects don’t
care to hear because when you use them you’re usually not telling them
things that will benefit them.


Just go back through your copy, look for any time you’ve used the
words “I, me, my, we, ours,” and change the perspective. Change the
verbiage.

Example: “I want to tell you something here.” Changed perspective:
“Here’s something you need to know,” or, “There’s something you need to
know in this situation.”

It sounds overly simplistic, but it’s not. People don’t want to hear about
you. They want to hear about themselves. _They_ want to be the hero of your
sales message. Not you. They want to picture themselves getting the
results, not you. They want the whole transaction to be about them, not
about you.

And the way you do this is to convert your copy from talking about
yourself to talking about them. How will they be enriched? How will they


31


benefit? How will they receive what they want? Search through your copy.
Look for “I, me, my, we, ours.” Then rephrase, rewrite, and reposition to
use the words “you, your, and yours” instead.

That’s it. Sometimes you’ll just rephrase a couple of sentences, or
maybe only a half of a sentence. In other cases, you might look at this and
say, “You know what? I’m talking about me here, and I’m getting off on a
little bit of an ego trip that has nothing to do with them. I need to rewrite
this to explain how this will benefit them. I need to show them how my
breakthrough will help them to get the results they want.”

It doesn’t mean you never use the words “I, me, my, we, ours,” but you
consciously do it, making sure you’re making it all about them. That’s how
you’ll make it work.

_It sounds harsh, but nobody cares about you_ . They only care about
themselves when they’re buying from you.


Summary:

Make your sales copy all about them (your prospect).


Go back through your copy and look for the words I, me, my, we,
ours. When you find those words, change the perspective so it’s all
about them—not about you.


Remember: prospects don’t care about you. They care about having
their needs met, their problems solved, their fears calmed, and their
desires satisfied.

# **Secret #5** **The Most Valuable Skill You’ll Ever Learn**

_“Every product has a unique personality and it is your job to find it.”_

_Joe Sugarman_


The most valuable skill you’ll ever learn is copywriting. People ask, “Is it
worth learning how to write copy, or should I outsource it to somebody
else?” The answer is yes. You need to do both.

However, I think Gary Halbert said it best.


_**“. . . Which brings me to a crucial point. If you are in need of truly world-**_
_**class copywriting, you’re probably going to have to learn to do it yourself.**_
_**You see, the few of us who really can do it, write copy that sells, are so**_
_**much in demand, you can’t even think about hiring us unless you’re**_
_**willing to spend an arm and a leg. Even then you’ll still have to wait in**_
_**line.”**_


One of the greatest copywriters in history is telling you to learn how to
do it yourself. Why? Because it’s going to cost you an arm and a leg and
you’ll have to wait forever to get that copy back from the copywriter.


33


### **Why should I learn to write sales copy when I can outsource** **it?**

We all need to get good at writing sales copy for several reasons. The
first one is speed. If you need it fast, it’s expensive. It’s one thing to hire
somebody to write a sales letter for you when they can fit it into their
schedule and you get it in two to four weeks. But when you say, “Hey, I
need a sales letter by next week.” They respond, “Okay. Here we go. That
sounds great. I’ll be glad to charge you my next week prices.”

The second reason is you don’t want to be held hostage. Whenever
somebody else is doing a critical business task for you, you are held
hostage, even if they’re benevolent. They have control, and there’s not
much you can do about it. Also, if you’re not good at writing sales copy,
you don’t know if their copy is good or not.

The third reason you need to get good at writing sales copy is to make
changes on the fly. Sometimes it takes longer to explain the corrections
you need somebody to make than to do them yourself. From my
experience, no matter what you get back from a professional copywriter,
you’ll have to make changes. Whether they are giving you their first draft,
their third draft, or their fifth draft, you’ll have to make changes. They
don’t know your business. They don’t know your niche audience. They
don’t know your product. They don’t know everything as well as you do.
You’re still going to have to work on it. Oh, and it will cost you more
money to get somebody to rewrite something that’s not working.

When you hire somebody to write copy for you, they’re going to write
copy for you. Is that sales copy going to work? You won’t know until you
run it. Whether it works or not, you have to pay them. You better know
whether copy’s good or not if you’re going to hire somebody. We’ll talk
more in another chapter about how to hire somebody to write copy for you.

When it comes to good sales copy, you need to be able to create it. You
need to be able to recognize it. You need to apply copywriting principles
in everything you do. You can’t isolate copywriting as a skill you don’t
need to develop, recognize or access. You will need a sales letter. You will
need a video sales letter script. You will need ads. You can’t say “I don’t
do copywriting. I’m the owner of the business. I’m the author, the creator
and the manager of this whole process.”

You need to create great copy because being good at sales copy helps
you with content creation—speeches, webinars, Facebook Live, everything
you’re going to do. The ability to create copy spills over into all these
areas and helps you sell more.


34


### **Develop A Copywriting Mindset**

A copywriting mindset is a dual thinking path. Let’s say you’re doing a
Facebook live video and you’re talking about the three things, or the three
ways, or the big secret to this or that. Suddenly, you’re getting to the end.
While still talking, in the back of your mind you’re thinking, “It’s time for
the close. Now I need to say something to invite them over here to do this.
Let me give them a benefit and then let me give them an invitation
statement.” I know what you’re thinking, “Damn, Jim, will I be able to do
that?” Yes, you can! You can develop the discipline of the copywriting
mindset and do it on the fly.

For instance, when teaching you about sales copy, I might close with:
“Those are the three reasons why you have to get good at copy. By the
way, if you want a cool shortcut to create amazing headlines, I invite you
[to check out Funnel Scripts at funnelscripts.com. We have a really cool 60-](http://www.funnelscripts.com)
minute training you can watch where we teach you 3 great secrets about
copy. Also, you can see a demo of this amazing, push-button tool that
gives you over 50 different copywriting hacks for everything from sales
letters, to headlines, to bullets, to video sales letters, to stealth closes and
more. Go ahead and check it out.”

That is what you need to be able to do. How do you develop this


35


copywriting mindset?


1. Focus on it.


2. Practice.


3. Pay attention to your results.


You can’t think, “I don’t need to know anything about sales copy
because I can outsource it.” That’s stupid. I know it’s wrong to call your
customers stupid, but you probably won’t have read this far and still be
thinking that. I’m not calling you stupid; I’m calling the other people
stupid. It’s us against them, which by the way is a cool secret.

You need to be good (or at least proficient) at sales copy first, then you
can choose which jobs you do and which jobs you outsource.

It’s all about knowing how to apply those principles and being able to
use them that makes a huge difference in your business. If you want to get
good at copy, I’ll tell you the best way to get good at copy fast. It’s like
getting good at pull-ups or getting into shape.

First, you have to commit. Second, you have to practice. Third, you
have to do it every single day . . . even when you don’t feel like it. It’s not
something you turn on and off. It is something you become. You have the
copywriting mindset. That’s how you do it. It’s commitment, practice, and
doing it every single day.

Commit to getting good at it. Then do it and practice it. Before you can
be great, you have to be good. Before you can be good, you have to be
bad. Before you can be bad, you have to try. You have to do something.
Then you need to pay attention to and measure your results. What’s
working and what’s not? It’s just like with working out. I can tell you for
the last six years every rep, every push-up, every mile down to the second
how long it took me to run each one and the total number of exercises,
circuits and everything else. Why? You have to be able to measure your
progress and results in order to improve your results moving forward.

Next, you do what works and stop doing what doesn’t. The only way
you’re going to know the difference is to do a bunch of it. The great thing
about the web, social media, and cheap traffic, you get feedback not in
weeks, not in months, not even in days. You get feedback instantly
whether what you’re doing is working or not. This is a fantastic
opportunity to get good at copywriting just because you can get so much
feedback so fast.

Study people who are doing it well. Look for mentors. These are people


36


who teach you in print, in books, and through live coaching. It’s just like
working out. When I committed to getting in excellent shape, I found the
best coach I could find to help me accomplish my objectives. Navy SEAL,
Stew Smith, trains people to go into the special forces—Navy SEALs,
Green Berets, MARSOC / Raiders, and Air Force Pararescue.

He coaches me to this day. When I started working out, I could do only
one pull-up. Now I can do 33 pull-ups in a row, which somebody would
tell you for a 50-year-old guy is almost impossible. It’s the same thing
with writing copy. You have to learn to flex those muscles. You may not
be capable of writing a million-dollar sales letter yet. But, with enough
practice, you can create a million-dollar sales letter faster than you think
possible.

The other way to get good is to learn with your wallet. I’m not telling
you to spend a ton of money on courses on how to write copy. I want you
to pay attention to the copy that either makes you spend money now or in
the past. Think about it. If the copy in someone else’s funnel, video sales
letter, or Facebook video makes you spend money, you need to dissect
that. You need to learn which sales messages work on you and why.

Here’s the reality. We are members of our own target market 999 times

_are_
out of 1,000. Either you a member of the target market you are going

_were_
after, or you a member of the target market you are trying to help. If
the copy makes you spend money, it’s good copy. You need to pay close
attention to it.

How long does it take to become an expert at copywriting? It’s a
lifelong commitment. It doesn’t just happen. You don’t reach that point
where you’ve “arrived.”

I’ve met some copywriters who are “masters.” They’re egotistical and
give off the aura, “Don’t talk to me because I’m cool.” It’s a bit of a
turnoff. Mastering copywriting is a never-ending process. You don’t get
into shape and then decide you don’t need to work out for the rest of your
life. Within a month of eating nothing but bonbons, beer, cake, steak, and
all those other things, you could undo years of hard work.

Even though it’s a process of developing and keeping that copywriting
mindset, you can hack the process. Here’s how: do it in stages. You don’t
need to master everything. But you need to do certain things in a specific
order.

### **First Step: Become great at creating headlines.**


Shameless plug: [FunnelScripts.com will help you create amazing](http://www.funnelscripts.com)


37


headlines in about 15 minutes. You can spend weeks and months
developing your swipe files, or you can plug your content into the swipe
files and wisdom of the ages when it comes to headlines using Funnel
Scripts. The choice is up to you. The number one copywriting skill you
must have to become an expert is to get really good at headlines. We’ll
spend more time on headlines in the next chapter.

### **Second Step: Become good at writing bullets.**


Why do you need to write good headlines and bullets? Because every
single piece of copy you will write will have a headline. The first words
people see on a page, the first words you speak in a video sales letter, the
title of your posts on Facebook, all use the principles of compelling
headlines. Bullets that describe benefits or arouse curiosity create pressure
in people to get them to take the action you desire.

In a Chapter 9 I’ll give you the ultimate bullet formula, but we won’t
go over that now. When you write compelling headlines and bullets, you
will jump far ahead of your competition. It’s almost pathetic what an
advantage you’ll have.

Then you need to get really good at calls to action and explaining and
framing offers. Become good at copywriting in this order. You might think
you need to get good at explaining your offer first. No, you don’t. If your
headlines suck, nobody will pay attention to your offer (or even see it).

However, if your headline grabs people’s attention, if your bullets build
pressure and create curiosity in people, if your call to action is compelling,
then your offer can suck, and you’ll still make a lot more money than if
your headlines suck and everything else is perfect. That’s why I tell you to
do this in stages. That’s how you’re going to quickly become an expert and
develop that copywriting mindset.


Summary:

Develop the copywriting mindset in all you do.


Master your headlines first because they will make the biggest impact
on your sales copy the fastest.


Pay attention to sales copy that gets you to spend your own money.
That’s good copy!


Never stop learning. Never stop observing. Never stop testing your
sales copy.

# **Secret #6** **The #1 Single Most Important Piece of Sales** **Copy Ever!**

_“On the average, five times as many people read the headlines as read the body_

_copy.”_
_David Ogilvy_


The number one copywriting skill everybody needs is to write great
headlines. I’ve seen statistics that eight out of ten people who see an
advertisement or a webpage read the headline, but only two out of ten read
the rest of the copy.

I don’t know if that’s accurate or not, but I can tell you from personal
experience that a great headline and mediocre copy will outperform
excellent copy with a weak headline. The reason is that great headlines get
you up to bat more often.

If your headline sucks, nobody reads your sales letter, nobody reads
your ad, and nobody watches your video. But, if you have a great headline
that grabs someone’s attention, people read your sales letter, read your ad
and watch your video.


40


**The purpose of a headline is simple: to get people to stop what**
**they’re doing and to start reading (or watching) whatever it is you put**
**in front of them.**

Whether it’s a physical sales letter, a sales letter on the web, a video
sales letter, an ad, a Facebook post, whatever it is, the headline will
determine your success without exception.

**Bottom Line: you have to write great headlines. That’s the number**
**one skill everybody needs to develop, no matter what you sell or who**
**you sell it to.**

The secret of a great headline is one that connects emotionally with the
person who represents your perfect prospect. A well-written headline
targets people emotionally, usually around either a fear or a desire. You
headline targets either something they’re scared of or something they
really want . . . and it does so on an emotional level.


A great headline targets your ideal audience. You don’t want people
who aren’t in your target audience reading past the headline. And, when
you think about online advertising where you have to pay money for
people to read your ad or click your ad, a great headline can actually cut
down on the _numbe_ r of clicks that you get, but massively increase the
_quality_ of the clicks you get.

The reason headlines are so important is because the whole sales
process cannot start unless the headline stops them in their tracks and gets
them to pay attention to what you’re saying.

### **Here are the consequences of not writing good headlines.**


41


1. You get terrible results.


2. You get frustrated and probably give up.


3. You waste a lot of time, energy, and effort in writing sales copy and

sales messages that nobody reads.


4. You are always at a disadvantage because enough of the right people

never see your sales message.


Let me tell you a quick story that illustrates this secret about headlines
in action. Hopefully, it brings this lesson home to you.

I had been selling online for about nine years at the time. I don’t
remember the exact date, but I created a product called “5 Steps To
Getting Anything You Want.”

Let me fill you in on a little backstory.
I was bankrupt and lived in a trailer park for seven years, but turned my
act around, in large part to my ability to write sales copy and sell
educational products (as well as overcome some self-esteem issues). I took
all the things I learned and turned it into this course I was extremely proud
of. I poured tons of time, effort, research, and work into it. I recorded it as
an audio CD (which was very difficult at the time), and we spent all this
money to produce the product. I was utterly wrapped up in this product
emotionally and financially when we started trying to sell it.

I ran ads for the product, sent email campaigns, and was excited
because I had this great message to share with people. I started seeing the
traffic come in but no sales. None. Zilch. Hundreds, then thousands of
people visited the website, but nobody bought. I freaked out. I thought,
“What the hell am I going to do?”

Then I took a deep breath and asked myself a question, “Okay, what
would a good copywriter do?” And this little voice responded
immediately, “They would test the headline.” So I changed the headline,
and within a few minutes I had a sale. I changed it again and I had five
sales. Now, I like to tell everybody, the change in that headline gave me a
500% increase in sales, but that’s not true.

I had an _infinite increase in sales because_ I went from zero to one sale
and then to five sales with the same traffic and the same exact group of
people coming through. The only thing I changed was the headline.

The original headline I ran (I’m going to paraphrase because I don’t
remember it exactly) was _“How I Took Myself From Bankrupt Trailer_
_Trash To Successful Online.”_ The final headline I changed to was _“How_
_To Gain A Positively Unfair Advantage In Business And In Life!”_ When


42


those sales started coming in after changing only the headline, the
importance of the headline came home to me in a very real way. That first
headline focused on me. Honestly, I think the whole bankrupt trailer trash
idea was a turnoff. People couldn’t connect with it. But with the emotional
benefit of _How To Gain An Unfair Advantage In Business And In Life_,
people thought, “Yeah, I’d like an unfair advantage.” It’s almost a guiltypleasure-type thing, a payoff where they can fill in the blanks for what an
unfair advantage meant for them individually.

Just by changing the headline I saved an entire project (and skyrocketed
my business). By the way, we did six figures with that product over the
next seven days. This story is the one that sticks out to me because it
showed how just changing one headline saved an entire business.

How can you apply this in your situation or business to get faster
results?

### **Acknowledge that you need to use headlines.**


That’s the number one thing. Most people forget or neglect the
headline. Even if it’s not a formal headline like you would have on a sales
letter, you need to think about the titles of your videos, blog posts, etc., the
same way you would think about a headline. They are that important.
Same thing goes for the simplest Facebook post. Anything you’re doing,
you’ve got to have that mechanism to grab people’s attention, stop them in
their tracks, and make them pay attention. The headline is how you do it.

There are some shortcuts you can use to implement this immediately.
One of the cool things about headlines (and almost all sales copy) is that
headlines follow formulas which you can model. And, the great news is
you can develop your own formulas by developing what we call a _swipe_
_file_ .

A _swipe file_ is a collection of advertisements you like, and you say,
“Okay, wow, that’s a cool headline I could use.” I found one of my most
successful headlines from the cover of a video game magazine. The title
on the front of _Xbox: The Official Magazine_ was “The Grand Theft Auto 4
Secrets You’re Not Supposed To Know.” I took that and turned it into
“The Ebook Marketing Secrets You’re Not Supposed To Know.” I used
that headline, along with a $49 product, to create a six-figure business.

A _swipe file_ is just a collection of ads that grab your attention. I like to
pick up the “Bottom Line” reports, People Magazine, the National
Inquirer, direct mail, catalogs, and more. And, most importantly, any
advertising that makes you buy (spend your own money) is something to


43


put into your _swipe file_ .

### **Here are some headline templates you can use immediately.**


The first group is “how to” headlines, so it’s how to get results.
Remember, people are avoiding pain; they’re seeking pleasure.

**How To Get ________**


_How To Get A Better Score On Your Next PT Test_
_How To Get Rid Of Acne_
Another thing that you can do is take a little riff on that how-to headline
by giving people a timeframe.

**How To ________ In As Little As ________**


_How To Double Your Pushups In As Little As 10 Days_
_How To Get Rid of Acne In As Little As 24 Hours_
It’s whatever appealing result they want—for how to do something or
get something—in a timeframe that they go, “Oh yeah, that’d be cool!” Be
careful that the timeframe is believable. Then you can take it even further.

**How To ________ In As Little As ________ . . . even if you**
**________!**


This headline template is where you take away a thing they think is
stopping them, an objection they might have, or a barrier they see in the

way.


_How To Pass Your PT Test In As Little As 2 Weeks . . . even if you_
_can’t do a single pullup right now!_
_How To Get Rid Of Your Pimples In As Little As 7 Days . . . even if_
_you’ve tried everything else and failed!_
That ending is a great one to use by the way. You can use that for

.
anything . . . _even if you’ve tried everything else and failed_

Here’s one more “how to” headline template that works really well.
**How Every ________ Can ________**


_How Every New Military Recruit Can Become A PT God In 12_
_Weeks!_
_How Every Teenager With Pimples Can Have Clearer Skin Fast!_
The second group of headline templates you can use is what I call
“ways to get what you want.” It works well with numbers too. The key
here is to use an odd number like 3,5,7,9—they seem to work better and


44


carry more credibility. These headlines work great for articles, blog posts,
and videos because they arouse curiosity. People want to read to find out
all the different ways or options for getting a result.

**5 Quick And Easy Ways To ________**


_5 Quick And Easy Ways To Max Out Your Pushups_
_5 Quick And Easy Ways To Get Rid Of Pimples_
**3 Fast Ways To Get ________ And Avoid ________**


3 Fast Ways To Get A Better PT Test Score And Avoid “Fat Boy” PT
Squad
3 Fast Ways To Get Rid Of Acne And Avoid Embarrassment
Then we can ramp them up with an “even if” statement which lets them
off the hook for past failure (something everyone wants)!

**5 Quick And Easy Ways To Get ________ . . . Even If ________!**


_5 Quick And Easy Ways To Get A Higher PT Test Score . . . Even If_
_You Failed Your Last Test!_
_5 Quick And Easy Ways To Get Rid Of Pimples . . . Even If Your_
_Social Life Is A Disaster Right Now!_
Again, you want to acknowledge something they’re worried about and
tell them it’s going to be okay.

The third group of headline templates that work well and grab people’s
attention revolves around “mistakes.” People are petrified of making
mistakes. In school, we learn that mistakes are BAD. Think about that for
a minute. A test score in school penalizes you for making mistakes. No
wonder people get so freaked out! Use this to your advantage with
mistakes headlines that grab attention.

**Which Of These ________ Mistakes Will You Make?**


_Which Of These PT Testing Mistakes Will You Make?_
_Which Of These Pimple Treatment Mistakes Will You Make?_
Then you can throw in who they are in the group to connect with their
identity and grab their attention.

**________ Mistakes All ________ Need To Avoid!**


_PT Test Training Mistakes All New Recruits Need To Avoid!_
_Acne Treatment Mistakes All Pregnant Women Need To Avoid!_
**________ Mistakes Every ________ Needs To Avoid!**


_3 PT Testing Mistakes Every Marine Needs To Avoid!_
_5 Acne Treatment Mistakes Every Teenager Needs To Avoid!_


45


The fourth template we can use is “warning” headlines. I don’t
remember where I read this, but it was life-changing to understand. It’s a
little-known fact about how animals respond to danger, especially in the
jungle. When one species of animal sounds a warning call, whatever it is,
ALL animals respond and pay attention. But when the all clear sounds, it
has to be specific to that type of animal. If a Macaw starts screaming that a
tiger is about to attack, all the animals pay attention. But when the Macaw
calls the all clear, the only ones that pay attention are the Macaws.

Using a warning headline is a way to get everybody’s attention, even if
they’re not in your direct target audience. You have to be careful not to
abuse it or have it turn out to be a bunch of hype because that’ll make
people mad. People are trained to pay attention to warnings. Warning
labels appear on virtually everything in our lives from prescription
medication to plastic bags on plush toys. People respond to being scared,
so grab their attention with a warning headline!

**WARNING: you can overdo this**


Don’t be like the little boy who cried wolf. If you use a warning
headline, do it intelligently and realistically. Otherwise, you kill your
credibility.

**WARNING: Here’s What Every ________ Needs To Know About**

**________**


_WARNING: Here’s What Every New Recruit Needs To Know About_
_PT Testing In Bootcamp_
_WARNING: Here’s What Every Teenager Needs To Know About_
_Over-The-Counter Acne Treatments_
**WARNING: Don’t Even Think About Trying To ________ Until**
**You Read This**


_WARNING: Don’t Even Think About Trying To Pass Your Next PT_
_Test Until You Read This_
_WARNING: Don’t Even Think About Trying To Get Rid Of Pimples_
_Until You Read This_
Here are some other headline templates you can try that work
extremely well under a variety of circumstances.

Once you realize headlines are templates, you’ll notice them all around
you. A great place to look is in line at the grocery store. Look at the
headlines and bullet text on the front of the tabloid magazines. Don’t read
the stories about celebrities interbreeding with aliens from outer space, see
the headlines about those topics, how they’re structured, and how you
could adapt them for your own headline needs.

Recognize that headline templates are all around you. Pay attention to
them. Develop your swipe file. You’ll start getting ideas, especially for
everything from articles and blog posts to email teasers, by paying
attention to which headlines catch
_your_ eye.

That’s a shortcut, by the way: develop your swipe file and pay attention
to formulas that help you to create headlines fast.

The most significant piece of advice I have for you when it comes to
headlines, besides acknowledging the fact that you need to use them, is to
consciously spend time on your headline and not treat it as an afterthought
like many people do.

In many cases, I devote 50% of the time I spend creating the entire
sales piece to the headline—whether it’s a sales letter, an e-mail teaser, a
postcard, a Facebook post, or something else. If that’s going to take me
two hours, I might spend an hour on the headline (not all the time, but
often). You need to give it the time and attention it deserves because it’s
such a critical element.

The headline starts the entire sales process.


Summary:

Spend a lot of time working on your headlines, especially for sales
copy and ads. It’s the #1 factor that determines success or failure.


Never post anything online without a headline or compelling first
statement. If in doubt, use curiosity to pull people in (Example: The


47


#1 Headline Mistake People Make That Bleeds Them Dry).


Once you have a headline that works, TEST new headlines against
that one to see if you can improve results. I’ve seen as much as a
500% improvement in sales just by changing a single headline.


48


# **Secret #7** **It’s NEVER “One Size Fits All”**

_“I don’t know how to speak to everybody, only to somebody.”_

_Howard Gossage_


There is a mistake most people make, especially online. They don’t
segment their traffic, which means they give the wrong message to the
wrong audience. Remember what we said about headlines? This mistake is
especially common with headlines.

Today, everybody puts up a webpage. When it’s done, people are so
excited and think, “Oh my God, my webpage is done. Thank you, God.
Now I can start selling.” They direct traffic to that sales page, but the
problem is that all traffic is not made up of the same people. In fact, there
are three different types of traffic you need to be aware of when creating
your sales copy, especially headlines.

Here’s a quote from Eugene Schwartz who was a master copywriter
from years past. When he wrote this statement, the internet didn’t exist.


_**“If your prospect is aware of your product and has realized that it can**_
_**satisfy this desire, your headline starts with the product. If he is not aware**_


49


_**of your product but only has the desire itself, your headline starts with the**_

_**desire. If he is not yet aware of what he really seeks but is concerned with**_
_**the general problem, your headline starts with the problem and crystallizes**_

_**it into a specific need.”**_

### **In our online world, there are hot, warm, and cold traffic** **sources.**


Somebody who is on your email list or follows you on social media
and knows your name is a hot source.


Someone who is looking for a solution to a problem, but they don’t
know about you yet is a warm source.


Someone who doesn’t even realize there’s a solution out there but
knows they have a problem is a cold source.


Each group needs to receive a different message from you. Therefore,
it’s not one-size-fits-all.

So I’ll give you an example using the physical training (PT) testing
example from a good friend of mine, Stew Smith. Stew is a former Navy
SEAL and a graduate of the US Naval Academy who trains all the special
ops guys coming out of the Naval Academy. He also prepares people for
the military, police, and firefighter professions. Stew sells information
about PT testing and preparation for physical training tests to either enter
or stay in some physically demanding occupations. Here are the different
messages he sends depending on the group.


Hot traffic source:


People who know Stew, who are on his newsletter list, see specific copy
every time he releases a new book about how to get ready for a PT test. It’s
straightforward. All the ads, all the copy, all the social media posts say,
“Hey, Stew Smith just came out with a new book called, “How To Pass
Your Next PT Test In As Little As Two Weeks. You need to check it out

because it’s going to show you how to do this, this, this, this, and this.”


This direct message works well for those people who know Stew.

Warm traffic source:


Stew targets people on Facebook who don’t know him, but are in the
military or some other profession where they have to get ready for a PT test.


50


He writes ads about preparing for the PT test, getting in shape (in case you
weren’t), what to do if you’re failing, and how to improve in specific areas.
All of these ads and posts direct people to his book, but he needs to get their
attention first with a solution they are already looking for. Then he leads
them to the books. They know their need (get ready for a PT test), they
know their desired result (pass the test), so they are receptive to ads and
content around those topics.


Cold traffic source:


This group of people is in terrible shape. They consistently fail their PT
tests, and they don’t know what to do to fix the problem. Therefore, they get
messages around topics like “Failed your last PT test? Don’t know what to
do? You’re not alone! Here’s a solution.”

### **With the targeted approach, each group gets different** **language in their sales message.**


However, most people’s sales copy reads, “We help people pass their
PT test!”

What’s wrong with this sales copy? People who already know you
don’t need that information. They need specifics about how you can help
them now.

People who don’t know you, but are looking for a solution, _may_
respond to that general message. They will respond better to specific
messages like “We help people pass the FBI academy PT test;” or “We
help people pass the RASP selection PT test;” or “We help people get
ready for a SEAL contract.”

Finally, for people who don’t even know there’s a possibility they
could pass their PT test or they’re focused on a specific problem like being
overweight, struggling with slow run times, or recovering from overuse
injuries, that general message won’t resonate with them at all.

When writing sales copy, you need to be conscious of these three
groups. Depending on where you are in your business, you may have a lot
of people in one group vs. another. If you’re just getting started, the
majority of the people will be in the warm and the cold groups. If you have
a business, product, or a service that requires a lot of explanation or people
don’t know the solution exists, then most of your traffic is going to be
cold.

If your traffic is cold, your message needs to focus on people’s
problems. Then you transition from talking about the problem to the need


51


followed by your solution to that need. Just like with headlines, it’s crucial
to attract the right people. Getting the correct sales message to the right
group of people can make a huge difference in whether or not you lose
money, break even, or you’re profitable.

By the way, the easiest place to segment your traffic using this
approach is on Facebook. And, fortunately now with tools like
_ClickFunnels_, it’s a lot easier to set up several different landing pages to
steer each type of traffic to, so that you can put the right message in front
of the right people.

Segmenting your message makes all the difference when someone is
looking at your headline and your ad. That person quickly decides, “Is this
for me? Does this guy understand my problem or not?”

### **So, what are the consequences of not applying this particular** **secret?**


You’ll have bad conversions because you’re putting the wrong message
in front of the wrong people. I’ll give you a little hypothetical story to
illustrate this.

You are having a conversation with somebody about Uncle Jim’s antivirus software you sell. This person knows they have a virus, but they have
no clue what to do about it. In this case, your message should focus on you
and your product.

But what if you don’t do that? What if you ignore them and tell them
only what you want to say to them?

The person says to you, “I think I’ve got a virus on my computer and I
don’t know what to do about it.”

You respond with information about Uncle Jim’s anti-virus software,
how it got a five-star review from the International Board of Software
Reviewers and they look at you and say, “Well, how do I get this virus off
my computer?”

You say, “Uncle Jim’s anti-virus software is ranked number one in the
world.”

This conversation doesn’t make any sense! You’re talking about your
product and yourself, and they’re talking about their problem.

Now, you might say to yourself, “Honestly, Jim! Surely, they can make
that mental leap to ‘Hey, it’s the number one anti-virus software in the
world. Obviously, it’ll take the virus off my computer.’”

But will it? Is it the right software for _their_ computer and the virus


52


that’s affecting _them_ right now? They don’t know the answer, and you’re
not giving it to them. Your software is _not_ their focus! Your brand is _not_
their focus! Your name is _not_ their focus! You’ve got to get in sync with
the conversation they want to have _first_, so you can steer them towards the
solution you’re selling.

So if they’re focused on problems, you start the conversation with the
problem to get in sync with them. Then show them you’ve got the
solution.

If your new friend with the infection is looking for a specific result or
solution such as, “Hey, I need antivirus software,” but they’re not saying,
“I need Uncle Jim’s anti-virus software.” Then you lead with, “Oh, you
need anti-virus software? Check this out!”

But if that same person says, “Hey, I’m thinking about Uncle Jim’s
anti-virus software,” then they need to see a message about Uncle Jim’s
anti-virus software specifically, _not_ a general ad about anti-virus software.

If they say, “I have a problem with my computer running slowly, and it
shuts off without warning sometimes.” You _don’t_ say, “You have a virus!”
You say, “Oh, your computer is running slow and shutting down
unexpectedly? There are three typical reasons for that. Let me tell you
what they are.” Then you lead them to potential fixes, including anti-virus
software.

Now I know the last point is a fine line (and you may need to re-read
it), but the fine line is the difference between selling 1% of the people who
show up to your website, and selling 20% of the people who show up at
your website!


**Shortcut:** The fastest way to figure this out is to think through the
conversations you could have with hot, warm, and cold people about your
product or service.


What would be the conversation with someone who knows who we

are and what we do?


What would the conversation be like with someone who is aware they
have a problem, but they’re not aware of us?


What would the conversation be like with people who know they
have a problem, but they have no clue a solution even exists?


To put this into action on a website quickly, make three different copies
of the webpage to create three different landing pages. Then, change the


53


headline of each page to match the traffic temperature based on the traffic
source (hot, warm, cold). Then look at the sales copy from your audience’s
standpoint and adjust the existing text to fit. A lot of times you can get 99yards down the field with a few simple tweaks, especially at the very
beginning of your sales message (often called the “lead”).

For the sake of expediency, don’t try to target each group at the same
time. Pick the one you think you can get the most mileage from the fastest
and concentrate on them first.

For example, if you have an email list, focus all your marketing on this
hot traffic source first! Do the same thing with your followers on Facebook
and other social media. After that, target the warm market, and then finally
write copy for the cold market. By the way, the cold market is usually the
largest. If you can connect with them, that’s how you break into the world
of _big_ sales!


Summary:

Acknowledge the different audiences who can use your product or
service.


Identify those audiences and commit to putting the right messages in
front of them.


Don’t be lazy and fall into the trap of one-size-fits-all with your sales

messages.

# **Secret #8** **Meet F.R.E.D. (Your Ideal Customer)**

_“Mirror the reader to himself and then show him afterward how your product fits_

_his needs.”_

_Raymond Rubicam_


Copywriting does not happen in a vacuum. When you are writing copy,
you are writing to a specific group of people. More specifically, you are
writing text that could be viewed by a million different people, but it gets
read one person at a time. It’s important you know who you’re writing to.
You’ve most likely heard the term “avatar” which refers to the perfect
representation of your ideal customer. I call your avatar Fred, your new
best friend.

In this secret, we will talk about how to define your target audience
avatar in a way you can use in the real world, why defining your target
audience matters, easy tools to allow you to quickly identify your avatar,
and how to look at your avatar differently.

I will teach you the 20% that’s going to give you 80% of the results.
You will be super-efficient with your energy, focus and effort. Many times
when people talk about avatars, they either make it complicated, or they
only teach you to create a story about your avatar. While this is useful
information (and better than not having one), you need to define your
avatar in a way that helps you create fantastic copy.

### **Why do you need to define your Fred?**


55


You need to know the words he uses and how he expresses his ideas.
You need to know what’s on his mind and what’s going on inside Fred’s
head. Because what’s going on inside his head will determine whether you
sell something or not, whether you get an opt-in or not, whether you get a
click or not.

You need to know what’s going on in Fred’s mind better than he does.
You need to know how to enter the _conversation_ going on inside his head.
If you aren’t talking about what he wants to talk about, if you don’t show
him what he wants to see, if you don’t tell him what he wants to hear, he
will ignore everything you have to say.

### **How to define your target audience?**


Before we go any further, you need to know that I got thrown out of
business school. I got a D-minus in Statistics. The only reason I passed
was because I agreed to drop out of business school and major in History.
Everything I’m teaching you comes from my direct experience; it is not
theory. This information is all based on hands-on, in the trenches, selling
people stuff, belly-to-belly, or through the web.

First, figure out who they are. There are two schools of thought when it
comes to defining your target audience. I prefer the term “niche” instead of
target audience because niche refers to a specific group or sub-group of
people.

Many times, when you hear people talking about niches, they’re talking
about keyword counts or keyword numbers. “My niche has 100,000
searches for this,” or “My niche has a million whatevers.” Here’s
something you need to understand. People will buy from you. A keyword
count doesn’t buy from you. More specifically, people will buy from you
one person at a time. You have to know who these people are and what
they have in common that makes them belong to the group.

When it comes to defining your niche, there are two schools of thought.
One is demographics. You measure and look at things like age (43-yearold white male). You look at gender. You look at the location.
Demographics are numbers-based.

The problem is that demographics are broad. Though I can tell you that
the typical people who buy from me are between the ages of 40 and 65,
60% are women, 40% are men, and they live in the United States,
Australia, Great Britain, Canada, and then smatterings all around the
world, that’s still too broad to be able to sell anything. It’s interesting that
people will key in on demographics, but if you try and use demographics


56


exclusively, you’re going to have a tough time selling anything to anyone.

I prefer using psychographics. Psychographics refers to what’s going
on inside of a person’s head. What are they thinking? What’s motivating
them? What are their attitudes or aspirations? I use psychographics first,
and then I refine my niche with demographics.

Psychographics are things I understand. Fred has specific problems.
Fred also has interests, desires and goals. These are the things that matter
in sales copy. If I know your problems, if I understand your interests, if I
know your desires, if I know your goals, then I know how to communicate
with you. I know how to put little presents out in front of you that get your
attention. I know how to get in touch with your feelings. I know how to
understand and identify various situations you’re going to find yourself in
where I can put my sales message in front of you.

You can use this information to narrow down your message because
understanding your audience is more about excluding people than it is
including people. I would rather have an audience of 10,000 laser-focused
people who I can give specific sales messages to, as opposed to 100,000
people who are casually interested in something that I’m going to waste a
ton of money putting sales copy in front of that will never buy anything.

You need to define who your target audience is and you need a specific
way to do that. That’s exactly what I’m going to help you with right now.

There are really three levels of definition.
The first is the idea of a niche. A niche is very broad. An example is
real estate. Real estate is too general to be able to run ads and write
meaningful sales copy.

Secondly, we need to move into what I like to call a sub-niche. This is a
narrower part of the bigger niche. In our example, a sub-niche would be a
real estate investor. Within this sub-niche there are different types of real
estate investors. I personally have been in several different niches. I’ve
been a flipper. I’ve been a buy and hold. I’ve been a hard-money lender.

Finally, we need to drill down even more to find our Fred. Now we
look at a micro-niche where we get laser-focused. Again, as the sub-niche
was a smaller part of the broad niche, a micro-niche is a narrower part of a
sub-niche. In this case, we might talk about flippers—someone who buys a
house, and turns it around in 30 to 60 days, hopefully, at a profit.

Now this micro-niche person is Fred . . . Fred the Flipper. Fred the
Flipper has very different needs than Ronnie real estate agent or Randy
real estate investor, or Sue and Johnny home buyer. Understanding Fred,
the Flipper helps your sales copy take a massive leap forward because you
have a better understanding of who they are.


57


Why do you want to narrow the field like this? First, it’s easier to
target. When targeting things like your ads on Facebook or Google
AdWords, buying media from other websites, buying ads on sites or in
people’s newsletters, you’ve got to know who you want to show your ads

to.

It’s also easier to find your niche because you know what they look
like. You can find more people and eliminate those who don’t match your
perfect target. You’re not only going to make more money, but you’re also
going to save money on ad costs.

Narrowing down makes it easy to communicate because you use the
words they use. Sales copy uses the magic words to convert them. These
are the words they’re using right now, so they know you hear them,
understand them and you’re not talking down to them. The right message
is the message that contains the words they’re using, they want to hear and
targets them directly.

Narrow is better.
Despite what some will tell you, it is tough to put out a message that is
going to be effective with a million people. That’s more of an institutional,
large-scale, general-type of offer. If you’re making a general-type offer,
and can find a group of a million that makes sense, and do well with your
ads, then do it. Most of us do much better if we can go a few feet wide and
a mile deep rather than going three feet deep and a mile wide.

### **How are we going to define our avatar?**


I like to call my avatar Fred. Fred started as an acronym for Fears,
Results, Expectations, and Desires (F.R.E.D.). That’s where the name
came from, but after diving into this and using this for years, I figured out
a better way to explain or to codify what an avatar is.

You need to give your avatar a name because when you sit down to
either write copy from scratch or use a tool like Funnel Scripts, you need
to have a specific person in mind. Remember, I said that you might sell to
a million people, but they each buy one at a time. You need to
communicate to a specific person instead of to a group.

In this example we used above, our house flipper’s name is Fred The
Flipper. If your niche is gardeners, are they green thumbs? I have a friend
that sells workout stuff. He refers to his avatar as couch potatoes because
they refer to themselves as couch potatoes. He helps them become
reformed couch potatoes. Are they mommies? Are they sci-fi fanatics?
What are they? Who are they? What is their name? You need to give them


58


a name. You can change it later, but you need to refer to a specific person.

Another thing you can do, and I have done this, is search Google for the
name. See what pictures come up under Google images. Then, pick one
and print it out. When you’re preparing your sales copy, you visualize
talking to or writing to that specific person. It makes a huge difference in
your ability to create quality copy.

### **Now that we know who, we need to talk about what these** **people want.**


When I was getting started, I thought, “I need to sell people what they
need. What do these people need?” What I learned was nobody buys what
they need. Everybody needs to lose weight, but they don’t do anything
about it. People buy what they want. Pointblank. End of story. All that
matters is .
**people buy what they want, NOT what they need**

You need to sell people what they want. You need to _want_ to sell
people what they want, not what they need. Some people get heartburn
over this. I’m not saying you don’t include what people need in whatever
you sell, but, from the standpoint of your copy, you only talk about what
they want. Do not tell them what they need. Because just like telling a
child they need to go to bed, they’ll think, “Screw you. I want to stay up,
snort pixie sticks, and watch the all-night Barney tube marathon on
NetFlix.” That’s what they want!


59


Don’t talk about what people need. Talk about what people want.
Include what they need in whatever you sell them or whatever service you
offer them. But, when you write copy, you only talk, speak, show, and
include what they want. It is crucial you understand this distinction. Often,
when I’ve taught this, people say, “Well, that’s not ethical. You need to
sell them what they need or they won’t get the result you promised.” What
I’m saying is you sell them with what they want; and you include what
they need.

### **Here’s F.R.E.D. at the next level.**


PQR2 is the secret code to your audience’s brain. What does PQR2
stand for?


Problems

Questions
Roadblocks

Results


60


Picture this. Fred is at the top of a chasm on one cliff looking at another
cliff across the way. Your people are here as well.


He wants to be on the other side. How is he going to bridge the gap?
Your sales copy will bridge the gap. What’s on this side where Fred is
standing? He’s aware of his problems. He’s got questions. There are
roadblocks. Definite things hold him back. He is completely tuned in to his
problems, his questions, and his roadblocks. He’s also tuned in to the
results he wants, which are over there on the other cliff. He wants to go
from here to there.

What’s going to help him do that (this is an important distinction) is
your sales copy. It is not your product, service, or software.


61


He can’t physically make this leap until he makes it in his mind _first_ .
Your sales copy helps him do that. His problems, his questions, and his
roadblocks have him firmly planted on the first cliff. What he wants are
results which are on the other side. These PQR2s are what define your
niche. You take these problems, questions, roadblocks and results and turn
them into a sub-niche or micro-niche.

Let’s look at it from another perspective. We know where Fred is. Fred
only thinks about PQR. He wants results, but the vast majority of people
are caught up in their problems. It’s like he’s stuck. On the first cliff, we
have the stick. On the other, we have the carrot. The power of the stick is
much more prevalent in his world than the carrot is. In fact, if you look at
it, it’s 3:1. Fred sees problems, questions and roadblocks on one side and
his desired results on the other side.


62


To move him across the chasm, you build a bridge with your sales
copy. If he has questions, you show him you have answers. If he’s got
roadblocks, you show him how to remove them because all he’s thinking
about are these problems, questions and roadblocks. For him to move
forward, he’s got to see you can solve problems, provide answers and
remove roadblocks. Only then will he believe he can get those results.
Only then is he willing make that journey across the bridge from where he
is now to where he’s going to be (and buy)!

Any form of sales copy can be used to help Fred move across the
chasm. It could be a video sales letter, a long-form sales letter, a content
video, an article, or any copy. Whether you think of it as sales copy or you
think of it as content, marketing, this is what’s going on inside of his head.
You get in tune with the problems, questions and roadblocks. Then start
knocking those down and show Fred how to get results with what you sell.

Remember when we discussed cold, warm, and hot traffic? This
concept deals with cold traffic and some warm traffic. If you want to go
crazy with your sales copy and make money, you have to address cold
traffic. Well, this is how you do it. You understand your avatar so well that
when they’re in the cold stage, you’re able to communicate with them
through problems, questions and roadblocks.

Focus on your avatar’s problems, questions, roadblocks and results.


63


You’ll have Fred’s 100% attention. He can’t think about anything else.
The conversation going on inside his head is only about these four things:
problems, questions, roadblocks and results.

The question for you, then, is how do you know what’s going on inside
Fred’s head? Where and how do you find out the problems, the questions,
the roadblocks and the results for your target avatar?

### **How do you discover Fred’s PQR2?**


1. **Live interaction.** When you’re at a big event, listen to what people

complain about. Where’s the problem? Where are they frustrated?
Where’s their pain? What questions are they asking?


2. **Look at yourself.** We are often members of our target audience either

currently or in the past. What are your problems? What are your
questions? What are your roadblocks? What are the results you
desire? You are a great insight into what Fred is feeling, holding him
back and has him up late at night in a cold sweat.


3. **Forums.** Forums are still alive and well on the worldwide web. Don’t

discount or ignore finding forums with specific members of your
target audience. Mine these for problems, questions, roadblocks, and
the results they seek.


4. **Your website’s help desk.** If you don’t have one, you should if

you’re selling anything to anyone. Your help desk is a great place to
look for the problems, questions and roadblocks. I’ve gotten some
million-dollar product ideas out of my help desk. You see trends as
well as specific questions. You may notice that five people had the
same issue in the last two weeks. If so, you have a new product idea.


5. **Popular products.** Look at specific things like e-books, print books,

physical products, or popular products to identify problems,
questions, roadblocks and results people are looking for.


6. **Answer** **sites** **like** **https://www.quora.com/** **and**
**Answers.yahoo.com.** Sites like these are great places to look for
questions people ask, especially if you’re not in the market to teach
people the latest and greatest techniques for selling stuff on
Instagram. For instance, my buddy Suzanne, does stuff around animal
behavior. Animal behavior, questions, and problems have not
changed in the last twenty years. The answers may have changed, but


64


the customer questions have not changed for your target audience.


7. **Surveys** . I love to do surveys because you get up-to-the-minute

thoughts and answers about people’s problems. These are especially
helpful if your niche is continually changing.


8. **Social media sites.** You can find problems, questions, roadblocks,

and results people are looking for in Facebook groups and Twitter.
Look at hashtags for what’s trending.


Look at these tools and sources. We’ve listed eight here, but there are
more ways to do it as well.

### **How do you use these tools to find what you need?**


1. **Answer sites** . Go to answers.yahoo.com and type in “real estate

flipping” and hit enter. You will see the questions people are asking
like: Is real estate flipping profitable? What is real estate flipping?
Does real estate flipping still make sense? How do I get started at real
estate flipping with no money down? How do I stay motivated? Are
there people that do this internationally? How do I attract new
partners? How do you start as an investment vehicle? Is it possible in
another country? What’s the ultimate guide? Where is the best place
to learn about this? How do you locate investors?
You become educated about the questions people who are potentially
in your target niche are asking. Then, use these questions to create
content, headlines, talking points, and the beginning of stories.


2. **Surveys.** You might not be interested in doing a survey yourself

through a site like surveymonkey.com. The good news is you don’t
have to. Here’s a cool thing. You can find other people’s surveys and
look at the results. Just go to Google and do the keyword search plus
the word “survey.” Ex: flip real estate survey. You’ll find data you
can review to know more about what’s going on with Fred.


3. **Social media.** Another way is to just ask people on Facebook a

question. Personally, I think this is one of the smartest things that you
can do. Ask in a group. Ask on a page. Ask on your profile page. Ask
people what their hardest struggle is or what their biggest question is.
People will tell you they’re concerns, questions, and roadblocks. A
fun way to get people to answer questions is to use a little meme as
part of your post on social media to attract attention. The bottom line


65


is that Facebook and social media are great ways to do surveys.


4. **Google search.** Search for your keyword, plus the word FAQ,

mistakes, questions, or top 10. You will get a ton of information that
can help you. Look at the top results to see what questions people ask.


5. **Popular products.** This is like “funnel hacking” or “audience

hacking”. What do you look at in an existing product? If it’s a book,
look at the table of contents. Look at the chapters and see what they
are about. Look at the index for keywords, terms, or maybe things
you never thought about. You can look at sales copy for offers on
people’s funnels and websites. You can also look at feedback because
that will show you how the market responds. The five stars on
Amazon will say, “this is awesome”. Look at the one stars to see what
people are bitching about. Looking at this information gives you real
insight into what people want. They’re looking for meat. They’re
looking for answers to their questions. They’re looking for value.
They’re looking for step-by-step information. They’re looking for

content.


What these come down to and what you need to focus on in your copy
is what people really want. Fred is on the first cliff. He wants to be on the
other one. Fred wants to change the way he feels. He wants less of some
emotion and more of another. He’s stuck in his head with PQR2 because
of fear. He feels fear, stress, pain, or boredom. That’s his reality. That’s
where most people are. Fred wants to change the way he feels.

But, you can’t change the way he feels by focusing on money. Most
business people key in on the money. Well, the money isn’t it. What Fred
wants is to change from fear to security. He wants to feel like things are
going to be okay, and he’s going to be safe. He wants to go from stress to
peace. He wants to go from feeling all frazzled to, “Huh, that feels good.”
He wants to go from pain to comfort. He wants to go from boredom to fun.

By the way, one of the most overlooked components of any sales copy
is focusing on fun. See how you can add fun. That’s one of the keys that
we use to sell the Jim Boat, a cruise seminar we’ve done since 2007. It’s
always on a different topic. Sometimes, on eBook marketing, other times
building your newsletter. It has been a different topic each time that had
different hot buttons we would key in on.


66


One of the important things that sells it is the fun. The fun of going on
this cool big boat, and having a good time with a whole bunch of likeminded people. We always end up on some tropical island, sitting under a
palm tree just visiting, drinking umbrella drinks, and having a great time
with everybody!

Paint the picture for your avatar of the cool stuff they will learn as well
as the fun they will have. Don’t discount the fun part.

How are we going to use PQR2 with your target audience? I want to
hammer it one more time. Fred is 100% tuned in to what’s going on inside
of his head. That’s it. He is tuned in to his problems, his questions, his
roadblocks, and the results he wants, but hasn’t gotten yet. There’s a
technical term for this called your Reticular Activating System. Basically,
you tune in to and recognize what you’re already looking for at the
exclusion of everything else.

All your content, whether it’s free or paid, needs to key in on the same
thing. Your ads, your blog posts, your videos, Facebook and social media
posts, live videos, memes and your webinars are all based around Fred’s
PQR2. Your headlines focus on his problems, his questions, his
roadblocks, and his results.

### **Your assignment**


Your assignment is to assemble Fred. You need to make Fred whole.
You need to get into action with your buddy, Fred.

First, define your Fred. Go from a large niche down to sub-niches then
to micro-niches. You can have more than one. Think of your niche like the
circles on a dart board. When you throw the dart at the board, a regular
niche is the outer rim. A sub-niche is the inner rim. The micro-niche is the
bullseye. You need to identify who you’re going after.

Next, identify and write down Fred’s top two problems. Then, what are


67


Fred’s top two questions? Then, what are his two big roadblocks?

Finally, what are the top two results that Fred desires?
Don’t be like most people and skip this assignment. Medium achievers
will write down two for each area, but the overachiever will come up with
five to ten. I want you to create a list of five to ten for each because the
first two are the easy ones. Three to four extras you come up with will
make you think. The fifth one is probably the magic connection.

If you do the ten, that’s when you dig in and deeply connect with Fred.
You want to get to the ones in each area that have emotional kick. How are
you going to use this insight about Fred? Use it just like magic.

Let me show you some headlines you can base on Fred’s PQR2.

# **Secret #9** **The Ultimate Bullet Formula**

_“Copy is not written. If anyone tells you ‘you write copy’, sneer at them. Copy is_

_not written. Copy is assembled. You do not write copy, you assemble it. You are_

_working with a series of building blocks, you are putting the building blocks_
_together, and then you are putting them in certain structures, you are building a_

_little city of desire for your person to come and live in.”_

_Eugene Schwartz_


Sales copy bullets are the workhorse of any copy. They are called bullets
from the term “bullet point” which is a dotted list on the page or screen,
typically 3-12 at a time. You see them on everything from Amazon listings
to long-form sales letters to email teasers to brochures. You use bullets to
arouse curiosity and give people reasons to take whatever action you want.
That action could be anything from ordering or signing up or calling on the
phone.

Bullets:


Build curiosity so you can create pressure inside people to get them to


71


buy faster.


Grab people’s attention so you can address their specific wants (and
needs) to make more sales.


Convey important information quickly so you can get your message
across fast to maximize every advertising dollar you spend.


The interesting thing is that when most people create bullets, they only
include features. For example, if it’s a drill, they’ll say, “Hey, it’s 18-volts,
and it’ll take up to an inch bit.” Like that means something to somebody!
Features are what we would put under “technical specifications.”

The problem is people don’t buy because of features. Features are how
they compare things. **People buy the benefits** . What are they going to get
as a result of that feature? You’ve got to understand the difference between
features and benefits.


_is_ .
A feature is what something
A benefit is what something _does_ _for_ you.
We’ll take the drill example. It’s 18-volts, which is the feature. But
what that feature _does_ is enable you to drill through hardwood like butter
so you can drill a bunch of holes without recharging the battery every five
minutes. The fact that it will take up to a one-inch bit (the feature) means
you can do all types of projects, especially around your home, without
having to switch tools (the benefit).

Again, understand the difference between features and benefits.
Features don’t make somebody buy something. The benefit of those
features gets them to buy from you.

You don’t need a thousand bullets in your copy. Depending on the copy
job, I would take four, five, six, a dozen excellent bullets over a fifty
crappy bullets.

Bullets have different functions in sales copy. You can put two or three
at the top of a sales letter right under the headline to suck people in. You
can use bullets in the description of a product, whether you’re selling it on
Amazon or your website or in an email. Bullets are what carry most of the
weight of your copy. Once your headline pulls them in, you can use bullets

to:


Summarize what people will see in a video.


Give people a preview of your blog post.


List the benefits.


72


Give people reasons to keep reading and to make a decision.


Summarize what they are buying.


And much, MUCH more!


If you don’t learn how to use bullets, then you will have a problem
creating the curiosity you need to drive people forward in the sales
process. You won’t build the pressure that gets people to buy.

Here’s a quick story about using bullets to sell something.
That sales letter I mentioned in the Introduction to this book that has
done over a million and a half dollars in $29 sales is for an e-book. To help
boost sales through that letter, I used a list of bullets that corresponded to
specific page numbers in the book. So for someone reading the bullets
about “What’s in the book?” it feels tangible because I’m telling them
things like:


How to get up, running, and selling on Amazon Kindle–FAST! (The
Web’s #1 e-book retailer WANTS to sell your e-book for you–here’s
how!) (Page 14)


The *sure-fire* secret to creating an e-book that sells like crazy while
having more fun than you ever thought possible! (Page 23)


How to quickly avoid the #1 Mistake authors make that causes them
to take months or years to write a book . . . so you can finish in just a
few days. (Page 7)


A step-by-step explanation of how to actually get a complete REAL
e-book DONE in less than 72 hours! (Page 103)


The absolute “bullet-proof” best e-book to write and sell online–
FAST. (Page 2)


I’ve done this with video products, too. You can write bullets that
provide the time stamp on specific videos to get the promise.

So bullets


Give people a reason to act.


Build curiosity.


Carry the load of explaining what your product is and what it will do
for them.


73


I think the all-time truism about features and benefits is only partially
correct. You’ve probably heard the old saying, “people don’t buy the drill;
they buy the hole.” Well, I think you need to drill down deeper than that!
What they want is not the hole in the wall; they want their wife to stop
bitching at them because they haven’t hung that picture yet. They want
their kid to be happy because they were able to put the nice neat hole in the
front of the birdhouse or make the holes to bolt the jungle gym together.

What we need to drill down to is the _meaning_ of each benefit.
So, here’s my go-to formula for creating bullets. You’ve seen it already
in this secret and probably didn’t realize it.


**Basic Bullet Formula**

**Formula: It ________ so you can ________**

Remember, Feature = what it is and Benefit = what it does.
Now, I’m sick of drills, so let’s switch to something sexy. Let’s talk
about wrenches! Here are some bullets I wrote for a set of Dewalt
wrenches I’ve been eying on Amazon for $29 but can’t seem to pull the
trigger to purchase. I guess I’m just not emotionally attached to them yet!

Here’s the original bullet list from Amazon:


**One-piece set**


**SAE sizes**


**Chrome vanadium steel construction**


**Stamped markings for easy wrench size identification**


Yawn. Not very compelling. But I want to want these wrenches, so let’s
give them some help, shall we?


**One-piece set** _**so you can**_ **keep all your wrenches together in one**
**place**


**SAE sizes** _**so you have**_ **the exact size you need when you need it**


**Chrome vanadium steel construction for strength and durability**
**work them hard**
_**so you can**_


**Stamped markings for easy wrench size identification** _**so you can**_
**quickly find the right size**


Already we’ve made a difference. That’s better than 80% of people do
with their bullets just by adding the benefit. But we want to do better than
99% of people out there, and that’s where my Ultimate Bullet Formula


74


comes in. Are you ready?


**Feature + Benefit + Meaning**

**Feature = what it is**

**Benefit = what it does**

_**means**_
**Meaning = what it** **to the buyer / reader / prospect**
**Formula: It ________ so you can _______ which means _______.**


So let’s light those wrench bullets on _**fire**_ and make even the most inept
dad with six thumbs on one hand believe he can finally be the mechanic he
always dreamed. A real “honey-do-list” house pro! Are you ready?


**One-piece set so you can keep all your wrenches together in one**
**place** _**which means**_ **you’ll never be left high and dry with the**
**wrong wrench**


**SAE sizes so you have the exact size you need when you need it**
_**which means**_ **you can get projects done faster and move on with**
**your life**


**Chrome vanadium steel construction for strength and durability**
**so you can work them hard** _**which means**_ **you‘ll spend a LOT less**
**money on tools over time**


**Stamped markings for easy wrench size identification so you can**
**quickly find the right size** _**which means**_ **no more pulling your hair**
**out over stripped nuts**


When you start talking about benefits and meaning, your sales copy
bullets (and your sales copy in general) will take a quantum leap in


75


effectiveness. And when you start _thinking_ in terms of benefits and
meaning, the sky is the limit as far as your selling power is concerned.

So, as we wrap up this secret, when writing bullets, get the momentum
going. It’s kind of like headline brainstorming. As you make bullets, you’ll
have ideas pop into your head for other bullets. As you focus on the
different features, benefits, and meanings of whatever it is you’re selling,
your bullets will get better and better. It’s kind of like warming up from a
run or exercising where the third or fourth or fifth set is when you get into
a groove. Your first bullet isn’t nearly as good as your fifth, sixth, or tenth!

Also, if you need five or six bullets, write ten or twelve and choose the
best five or six. Again, it’s just a game of momentum. And one last thing.
You can build up a very effective swipe file for bullets. I would highly
recommend you start creating a clip file of bullets you see that catch your
attention. Just like having a swipe file of headlines, having a swipe file of
bullets can come in handy when you need to brainstorm a bunch of them
quickly.


Summary:

Bullets are the workhorse you use to create curiosity in your copy.


Five amazing bullets will outperform 30 good bullets.


Always include meaning in your bullets because that’s the secret
sauce that makes them better than everyone else’s bullets!


76


# **Secret #10** **What REALLY Sells People (It’s NOT What** **You Think)**

_“There are two motives to action: self-interest and fear.”_

_Napoleon Bonaparte_


_“When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic,_

_but creatures of emotion.”_

_Dale Carnegie_


This secret is about the why and how to get people to react with emotion,
because emotion is what drives sales. It takes the previous secret about
bullets to the next level. How? Well, we talked about features and benefits.
Features are what something _is_ (it’s got an 18-volt drive motor; half-inch
drill bit capacity; it’s a 30-minute real-time exercise DVD, etc.). The
benefit is what that feature _does for_ somebody. Meaning is what those
features and benefits combined _mean_ to someone.

They know the benefit of the 18-volt drive motor is that it gives you


77


more power and you never run out. You’re never at a loss to do your
projects. But that last step is the most critical. You need to tell people
about the outcome.

**Meaning creates emotion.**
The 18-volt drive motor has all the power to handle any project.
What does that mean to my ideal prospect?
In fact, you need to ask that question about _any_ claim or feature or
benefit you present to people in your sales copy.

It could mean your wife is happy you’ll get the honey-do list done
quickly. It means you’ll burn through every job with enough time left to sit
down on the couch and watch the football game. It means you’ll see the
smile on your kid’s face when you finish up that project you’re doing
together. It means you’ll have some more free time this weekend instead
of waiting for the battery to recharge.

Meaning is the next level of connecting with people on a gut level
about what your product, service, software, etc. will do for them, which is
where people buy. Because you may have heard “people buy on emotion
and they justify on intellect”—and that is _true_ !

How do you find the meaning? Easy! Every time you see a claim,
feature, or benefit, ask yourself some questions: “ _Why_ is that important?”
“Why does that matter?” “Why is that a big deal?”

Now you might ask, “Why would I want to make a drill emotional?”
And my response is if you sell drills and want to sell a lot of them, get
people emotional about the drills. Make them feel cool by owning that
drill. Make them feel smart by having that drill. Make them feel like
they’re a member of the tough-guy-club or popular by owning that drill.
Make them feel like they love their kid by having that drill.

Do that, and you’ll sell more drills!
By the way, this idea of injecting emotion through meaning applies to
anything you sell, which is why it’s important. Emotion is what sells. You
have to drill down (pun intended) to that emotion, find it and expand it.

Now you might be saying, “Man, that’s stretching it.”
Is it? When I say, “The drill has a magnetic plate on the front so you
can keep screws secure while doing your job. That means there’s no
chance of those sharp screws dropping and hitting somebody on the head
while you’re ten-feet up on a ladder. That one feature could keep someone
from getting a screw embedded in their head . . . maybe even your kid.”

Again, you might think that’s a little bit of a stretch, but it’s not!
You’ve got to drill down to that emotion tied to each one of those features.
The cool thing, it’s just like taking those bullets or any other claim and

doing that first part of the formula “It ______ so you can _____.” Now
you’re dimensionalizing the product. Now, you’re getting to the part that’s
going to get people to say, “Yeah, that’s what I want to _feel_ . That’s what I
care about. I don’t care that it’s blue, or it’s got this logo on it, but I want
my kids to be safe. I want my wife to be happy. I want to be able to relax. I
want to get this damn honey-do list done so I can sit down and watch the
game and fall asleep and spill nachos all over the front of my shirt.”

That’s what this drill means. As soon as you can make that connection,
your sales will get pumped up! The consequences of not doing this are
severe. If you can’t connect on an emotional level, then you’re the same as
everybody else. Then people evaluate your product, coaching, software, or
whatever you sell based on price alone because that’s all they have to go
on. You haven’t made them feel anything! But as soon as you make them
feel something, that’s when you have them. They need a powerful WHY if
you want them to buy because **WHY creates emotion.**


Now, I’ll tell you a quick story.
Here’s the reason I signed up to do physical coaching with a guy named
Stew Smith. He sends me workouts through email, even though I’ve been
working out already and own plenty of books with exercises. Stew lets me
call him on the phone and ask him questions about workouts, but I had
other people I could call for free. The reason I initially signed up with him
was the emotional motivation of, “Hey, my trainer is a Navy SEAL. That’s
pretty badass!”

Initially, I enjoyed the emotional ego hit of telling people, “Hey, my
personal trainer is a Navy SEAL.” And I let that slip every once in a while,
maybe more than I should because it is pretty cool. But here’s the
interesting thing. That emotionally charged reason for signing up with
Stew got me motivated enough that, now in my 50s, I’m in better shape


79


than most 25-year-olds. (I can do 33 pull-ups, 100 push-ups, and 100 situps in a row without stopping.)

All because of that emotional connection to my trainer being a Navy
SEAL, I’m


A. Not going to let him down by slacking on workouts.


B. Not going look like Mister Potato Head ever again, especially if I

want to tell people my trainer is a Navy SEAL.


That emotional reason for signing up/buying/clicking has all types of
consequences for your sales funnel as far as your prospect is concerned.
You’ve got to find that emotional connection and amplify it. The more
emotions you can tie your product or service to like love, fear of _____,
hate, and hope, the better off you are.

Putting this into action is super easy. Here’s the trick.
As soon as you make a statement about what something _is_ or what it
_does_, you use those two magic words “which means ______.”


“. . . which means you will _____.”

“. . . which means you will be able to go sit down and relax.”

“. . . which means you can _____.”

“. . . which means you can enjoy spending more time with your
family.”

“. . . which means you don’t have to _____.”

“. . . which means you don’t have to waste an entire Saturday doing
chores.”


That’s how you do it. That’s how you find the meaning. And the more
emotionally charged you can make that meaning, the more sales you’ll
make! Tie your product to:


Love for _____ (family, self, country, community, etc.)


Hate


Fear of _____ (failure, making mistakes, death, loss, etc.)


Vanity


Pride


Longing for _____ (fulfillment, peace, completion, etc.)


80


Greed


Freedom


Tie your product or service to the things people want at their core, and
you’ll be able to connect emotionally much more quickly.

Now that you’re conscious of this, you need to use this knowledge to
your advantage. You need to include this emotional component in the mix.
As soon as a feature comes out of your mouth, imagine a customer asking
you “Why?”

“Why is that important?” “Why should I care?” “Why does that matter
to me?” “What does that mean to me?” Almost like an annoying child who
just snorted a Pixie Stick at midnight on Halloween who now has a case of
“why-a-rhea!” Imagine that incessant, why, why, why, why, why, and it’ll
force you to come up with the answers.

Again, it’s one of those things where you build momentum. Write out
ten, twenty, or thirty reasons why a feature or benefit matters to them. It is
that important to your business and your ability to create awesome copy.
Find that emotional connection.

Now the truth is, when you do this exercise, you don’t find the
emotional connection with the first thing you write down. It happens after
you work your way through the easy ones and force yourself to keep
going. When you get past the superficial level and start drilling down
below the surface, then you will tap into the true emotions.

Emotional connection is how you turn lookers into buyers. It is how
you turn buyers into raving fans. And, it is how you turn raving fans into
customers for life!

So that’s the secret to what really sells people. It’s not what _you_
think . . . it’s what _they_ feel.


Summary:

People buy on emotion and then justify with logic.


The primary emotional motivations to buy are fear and desire.


You should strive to make an emotional connection with your
prospects and buyers by tying your product or service to as many
different reasons why as you can.

# **Secret #11** **Why Good Enough Makes You (and keeps** **you) Poor!**

_“The Enemy Of Great Is Good!”_

_Unknown_


One of my early mentors was a successful real estate agent. Some people
thought he was pompous. Part of the reason was that he would not accept
anything other than total excellence. He had a sign on his door that said,
“The Enemy Of Great Is Good!”

That always stuck with me. When something is good enough, it will
never be great. How does this apply to sales copywriting? When a piece of
sales copy works, we tend not to want to touch it because we get
superstitious or scared. We know it took effort and work to get it to this
point where it’s making us money. The fear is that if we change the copy it
will “break” and stop working (and maybe not start working again when
we change it back)!


82


Let’s say, for example, that for every dollar you spend you bring in
$1.10 or $1.20 or $1.52. So it’s good enough, and you don’t want to mess
with it. (Hey, you’re making 50% profit!) But that mindset keeps you
poor. Only once in 25 years of writing copy have I seen an instance where
the original headline and the original copy could never be beaten.

Usually, you find a way to make it better using a simple process called
A-B split testing. A-B split testing means you take something that’s
working and test it against something else you hope will give you a better
result.

Here’s how this works. You have two versions of your copy: the A
version and the B version. You run the test for a while (preferably a test
tied to a measurable result like total sales, clicks, subscriptions, etc.) Then,
if the B version beats the A version, the B version becomes the new A
version. Now you have a champion you’ll try to outdo with a new version.
They call this champion “The Control.”

So A/B split testing tries to constantly improve your best copy and
make it convert better.

Refer back to the example in Secret #6 where I changed a headline, and
my sales increased from zero sales to five sales in two minutes (a 500%
increase). Another example in the Introduction talked about changing a
website from 20 pages to one page and sales increased by 250%.

What if I hadn’t made those changes? Would you be reading this right
now? Hell no! I’d still be living in the trailer park delivering newspapers.
If I had not made those changes, we never would have made the money
that we made. My life would have been completely different.

So it’s critical that once you’ve got something working, you _must_ test
to make that copy better. Little incremental improvements can produce
massive profitability.

### **$100 Product Example**


For example, you have a $100 product for sale with a 1% conversion
rate on your sales letter.

That means you make $100 for every 100 visitors who come to your
website. (100 visitors x 1% conversion = 1 sale at $100).

Let’s say it costs you $90 to get 100 visitors to your website resulting in
one sale. (I’ll assume you’re selling an e-book or something with no
physical delivery costs.)

That means you spent $90 on traffic. You made $100 in sales. Your
gross profit is $10.


83


Now, let’s start testing.
You test your headline and increase your conversion from 1% to 1.2%.
That measly little .2% increase in conversion can’t mean much, can it? On
the contrary, for every 100 visitors that come to your website, you’re now
making $120, but you’re still just spending the same $90 (your cost didn’t
go up).

You just tripled your profitability! How? Instead of making $10 profit,
you’re now making $30 profit. Same traffic. Same advertising expense.
With this simple headline test, you tripled your profitability.

What if you tested a few of the bullets and raised conversion by just
0.1%?

What if you tested the offer itself and raised conversion by 0.15%?
What if you tested a simple picture at the top of the page and raised
conversion by 0.25%?

Now you’re converting at a rate of 1.7%. Nothing else has changed in
your costs, but you’ve increased profits by 700% ($70 profit vs. $10
profit)! Hey, you’re making $170 for every hundred visitors instead of that
stinky $100 you were so happy with before you started testing.

This process can be repeated multiple times once you understand it
needs to be done and have the courage to do it. The funny thing is, it
doesn’t take courage to do it! Why? Because if you try a new headline and
it doesn’t do as well, you turn it off. It’s not like you’re a loser if it doesn’t
work as well as the first version. Go back to your original champion and
start looking for a new challenger!

My friend Russell Brunson’s book _108 Split Test Winners_ details over
100 tests his company did to explode profits, skyrocket sales, and create an
avalanche of subscribers. You can get the book for FREE (you only pay
shipping and handling) here
[https://CopywritingSecrets.com/freesplittestingbook](https://CopywritingSecrets.com/freesplittestingbook)

By the way, all this testing used to be super complicated and technical
to do which is why few people did it. But now, with incredible tools like
_ClickFunnels_, it is easy to implement A-B split testing. There are plugins,
software, and services out there that make it inexpensive to test. It’s easy
to set up, and you _must_ do A-B split testing with everything, including:


Headlines


Offers


Prices


Bonuses


84


Email subject lines


Calls to action


Order button text


Colors


You can test all of these and more. However, here’s the number one
thing you need to understand:

### **You never test more than one variable at a time.**


If you’re going to test a headline, test one against another, but
everything else on the page stays the same.

If you’re going to test the text on your order button, that’s all you’re
testing and everything else on the page stays the same.

As soon as you start changing more than one variable at a time your test
results become invalid.

Use a tool to automate the testing process. Whatever you’re using for
your website, see if there is a built-in A-B split test feature. If not, then go
out and _find_ a tool. Do a Google search for “A-B split testing tools” and
find tons of options.

### **Your takeaway on this secret is this: Start testing.**


Start! Test one thing at a time. Don’t accept the results you’re getting
now are as good as it’s going to get. Think about it. Most retail businesses
are operating at a 10% profit margin. Imagine! By doing a simple test on
your website, your flyers, and your ads, you increase conversions by a tiny
% and explode your profits. What would that mean to your business and
your family? For many thin-margin companies, it’s totally life-changing!

So much hidden profit is right there waiting for you, just by testing a
few simple things. You can’t afford _not_ to do this!


Summary:

If you’re not testing, start testing immediately.


Never test more than one variable at a time.


Test for actions like purchases, clicks, or subscriptions.


Automate your testing. Don’t do it by hand if at all possible.

# **Secret #12** **Don’t Reinvent The Wheel—Great Copy** **Leaves Clues**

_“Your job is not to write copy. Your job is to know your visitors, customers and_
_prospects so well, you understand the situation they’re in right now, where they’d_
_like to be, and exactly how your solution can and will get them to their ideal self.”_

_Joanna Wiebe_


You need to do the right research before you start creating your sales copy.
Why? So you’re immersed in the mindset of the people you’re targeting
with your sales message. Now, what type of research would you need to
do? What do you need to know?

### **What do they want more than anything?**


86


What are their big desires? What are their fears? What scares them?
What are their objections to buying stuff like what you’re trying to sell?

You need to find out these things:


What do they want?


What are their fears?


What are their objections to buying either what you sell or what
anybody is selling out there?


87


If you do that, you have a massive advantage over the other people
creating sales messages.

Look at the sales messages your customers see in the marketplace.
Look at the number one bestselling books on Amazon that target your
audience. Read the back cover copy. Look at the chapter titles. See the
sales messages used to get these people to buy.

This process is called “funnel hacking.” Look at what’s already
working with an offer, sales copy, and product, then apply that to what
you’re doing with your products and services. You don’t steal what others
are doing, but you do model how they’re approaching and selling to the
marketplace.

### **Where do you research?**


Amazon is my number one source for research. Not only can I see what
people are buying since Amazon has everything listed in categories of best
sellers, but I can also look at the comments that people make and their
feedback (or lack of feedback) on every product. I read the five-star
reviews to see what gets people excited.

More importantly, I read the one-star reviews to see what has people
pissed off and make sure I don’t do that with my offers.

But the real gold when you’re looking at reviews is in the two, three,
and four-star reviews. Why? Because those are the people who liked some
of it and didn’t like other parts. Those are the most helpful people because,


88


quite frankly, the five-star people are often fanboys and the one-star people
are just bitter “know-it-alls” who hate life. The two, three, and four-star
people explain, “Hey, it did this, which was good, but it didn’t do this,
which upset me.”

Use their words to help write your sales copy.
Let’s say you’re selling a product about how to speak Spanish. You
notice people complain that a popular product doesn’t teach you
conversational Spanish. Instead, it sounds like you’re learning straight out
of a classroom.

Here’s how you can use that feedback.


1. Clue yourself in on what to include in your own product.


2. Emphasize how your product uses conversational Spanish.


3. Use that angle in your headline, “How To Learn Conversational

Spanish In As Little As Two Weeks!”


Those are the things you find out when you do the research. You have
to immerse yourself in the sales messages potential customers are seeing
and how they react to them.

Google is another great research resource. If I want to solve a problem,
I’ll search Google to see what comes up. Read the blog posts, look at the
ads, look at the keywords people use and the related products. Look for the
ideas people share in blog posts and articles. Look at the questions people
ask. It might take a couple of hours or a couple of days to immerse
yourself. It might take you a week, depending on your schedule and how
well you know your audience. But it’ll be the most valuable couple of
hours, couple of days, or week that you ever spend. This research is how
you see the words people use and connect with them in your sales copy.

The consequences of not doing this are severe. Quite frankly, if you
don’t use the words they use, if you don’t resonate with them, they will not
buy from you.

Your sales messages will fall flat with your target audience. They won’t
pay attention to your headlines. If they do pay attention to your headline,
then your copy won’t work and your ads won’t be any good.

Immersive research helps you pretend you are one of your prospects
with the same problems and desires. See what’s available out there. Look
at the sales messages and the feedback, especially for products and
services that are popular with your target audience.

Immersive research gives you a direct way to take advantage of where


89


your competitors are succeeding _and_ where they’re failing. It
automatically positions your offer as a unique and better solution just by
understanding the market through research.

Feedback from one of my products brought this home to me in a big
way. For almost two years I had the number one PowerPoint educational
DVD on Amazon. We sold thousands of this thing. While looking at the
feedback, I realized that some people felt like the entire DVD was a pitch
for a piece of software called Snagit®. I thought, «What the hell are you
talking about? I demo how to create a PowerPoint presentation with all
these different slides, and I use Snagit as the example to build the
presentation around. I don’t care if you ever buy Snagit. I don’t even tell
you where to get it!”

But it shows that people don’t pay attention! (Big surprise there.)
They’d buy the DVD and watch it, but they didn’t pay attention to the
slides I made using Snagit as the example. They skipped ahead and
watched the part of the training where I showed the final presentation
which happened to be an excellent presentation for Snagit! But if they had
watched the whole instructional video, they would have seen that I built
the presentation in front of them.

This confusion never occurred to me, but I changed some verbiage and
part of the sales copy which cleared it up. It’s a great example of why you
want to look at the feedback from your competitors. However, you also
look at your feedback to improve your own sales copy.

My competitor could have exploited this issue to their benefit by saying
something like, “And unlike other training, we don’t try to sell you
anything extra. We include everything you need to make amazing
PowerPoint presentations and don’t pitch any extra software.” Even
though it was BS, and I wasn’t pitching, a competitor could have smoked
me if they’d been paying attention.

Another place to do research is your frequently asked questions that
come in, or your email support tickets. Those are a goldmine. Nobody
wants to read the negative feedback or objections, but if it makes you a
whole lot wealthier, then that’s enough motivation to do it.

When you sit down to write your copy, research needs to be part of
your planning process. Say, “Hey, I’ve got to write a sales letter, a
postcard, or an email. Let me designate a couple of hours to do some
research. If I’m selling a book, let me research popular books. I’ve got to
write a sales letter for my software, let me go research software.” Make
this part of the copywriting process. Instead of opening your word
processor and staring at the blank blinking cursor, wondering what to


90


write, do some research! Get your mindset in the right groove, and some
amazing copy will result.

As I’ve said before, writing copy is a game of momentum. You need to
get your copywriting engine warmed up before you write. Kickstart that
process by reading other people’s text and the feedback from customers on
the related things they buy. This practice gets you into that copy mindset
and makes it easier to start writing.

My best piece of advice about the research before writing sales copy is:


1. Just do it. Get the words, feelings, and ideas directly from sales copy

that engages people.


2. Understand the reactions of people. Amazon and other sites that allow

you to look at reviews are your goldmines.


Spending a few hours researching similar products helps you get into
the flow of creating sales copy. The result is better sales copy, written
_much_ faster.


Summary:

Never write sales copy without doing research.


Research gives you the words and the intel you need to write better

copy.


Only a fool sits down at the keyboard and starts writing copy cold
without warming up first.

# **Secret #13** **It’s All About Them—Never About You**

_“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”_

_“Make it simple. Make it memorable. Make it inviting to look at. Make it fun to_

_read.”_

_Leo Burnett_


Once you talk to your audience, you tend to want your audience to see
how smart you are. You use industry jargon or big words. You want them
to know you know what you’re talking about. This tendency happens no
matter what you’re selling.

If you’re selling a drill, you start talking about voltage and torque.
If you’re selling a coaching program, you talk about your 25 years of
experience and how you know these cool things.

If you’re selling software, you talk about gigabytes and use hard-topronounce words.

However, you actually prove to people how smart you are by
communicating with them in a way they can understand! When they can
still track with you despite being harried, confused and only partly paying


92


attention, that’s when you prove how smart you are. You do that by
making it all about them.

Making it all about them means you avoid being cute, using sarcasm,
inside jokes, or using anything that could be misconstrued.

You avoid trying to prove how smart you are by using big words,
industry jargon, or acronyms you don’t explain. All that does is confuse
people and turn them off.


One thing I’ve learned in sales is that a confused mind always answers
“No!” Someone who’s confused never agrees to buy. Maybe one in a
thousand does, but you usually can’t make money off of one in a thousand.

When you are making a sale that involves a lot of emotion with a
person who is scared, feels self-conscious, believes they’re going to get
ripped off, or is afraid of making a mistake, it is critical that your
communication is crystal clear. Be very conscious of what you say to
people.

In the mortgage business, we learned to talk about complicated
financial stuff in a way that made sense to people who didn’t want to
understand what we had to disclose. For example, one thing we had to
reveal was the high probability that the servicer of their loan would
transfer to another party, but the principal was still owed, and the interest
would never change.

I took two pages of complicated disclosures and just explained, “The


93


company you make your mortgage payment to will most likely change.
The only effect that has on you is who you make the check out to each
month and where you send it.” It was so effective at cutting down people’s
anxiety that the VP of the mortgage company had me do a training for the
other loan officers on how to do disclosures.

That’s when I really learned to use words my target audience
understood to help them make a good decision. The consequences of not
doing this is making people feel stupid.


If you make somebody feel stupid, they won’t buy from you.


If someone feels like you’re making fun of them or talking down to
them, they won’t buy from you.


If they feel like you’re too smart for them to understand, they won’t
buy from you.


If you talk in circles and they get confused, they won’t buy from you.


So you need to use the words they use.


You need to talk in simple terms they understand.


You need to use short sentences.


You need to keep your thoughts well-organized and sequential.


If you can do that, you’ll serve them better and help them achieve the
result you’re trying to sell to them.


.
**Don’t use big words**
Whenever I write something that has the potential for confusion, my
secret strategy is to give it to my street-smart wife. She was a 911dispatcher for seven years and then worked the front desk at the police
department for five years. She’s been there, done that, and seen it all as a
great student of humanity. The good news is that she didn’t graduate from
college. All she knows to do when software doesn’t work is to yell for me
to come to her office and fix it.

These qualities make her the perfect person for me to give a piece of
copy and ask, “Hey, would you read this and tell me where it’s not clear?
Where it doesn’t make sense?” She’s excellent at that. I’ve used my
mother for that role as well.

Find somebody who doesn’t know what you know and get them to read
your sales copy and see if they understand it. If they can understand it,


94


then you’re on the right track. And no, they don’t have to be a member of
your target audience to be an effective sounding board for your sales copy.
In fact, it often helps if they aren’t.

I’ve also heard people say to give your sales copy out to a bunch of
people, and if they come back to you and say, “Ah, it’s pretty good,” that
means it’s not good at all. Why do these experts say that? Because what
they want is for everybody who reads it to say, “Wow, that sounds cool.
Where can I get one?” If people come back and say, “Hey, it’s pretty
good,” then you still have work to do on your copy.

Now, of course my wife’s not going to buy anything I’m selling, so
that’s not a good litmus test, but you get the idea. Also, unless the people
you hand the copy to are in your target audience, they aren’t EVER going
to say “Hey, where can I get one?” So that old saying only holds so much
water in my book.

If I had to boil all this down to one big takeaway, it’s this: Write or
create your sales copy so it speaks directly to your ideal prospect.

Write to a single person; don’t write to a group. Write to someone you
know who represents the perfect person in your target audience (remember
Fred from Secret #8). This trick works exceptionally well when you are
stuck.

True story: My buddy George, represents my audience. If I’m stuck
writing a sales letter, video sales letter, or any piece of copy, then I say,
“Hey George, I’ve got something you need to hear about.”

Writing to George works well for e-mail teasers because I have a
tendency to get detailed in my emails and make them fifty pages long
when they only need to be five lines. When I find myself doing that, I’ll
throw it all away and just start typing an email to my buddy, George.


Subject: Cool software I just found

Hey George,

I just found this cool piece of software.

I know you’re really interested in _____ and this is really neat.

You want to check it out because it does this, this, this, and this.

Here’s the link. LINK

I’ll talk to you soon.

Bye.

95


Emails you compose as if to a specific person will outperform
everything else 99% of the time.

Always remember that millions might read your sales message, but
you’re selling to one person at a time.

Talk like them.
Use words they understand.
Never make them feel stupid!


Summary:

A confused mind always answers “No” in a sales situation.


Keep your messages simple and direct.


Don’t use big words and don’t make people feel stupid.


It’s not about how smart you are; it’s about how much you can help
them.

# **Secret #14** **What To Do If You Don’t Have Any** **Testimonials Yet**

_“We have become so accustomed to hearing everyone claim that his product is the_

_best in the world, or the cheapest, that we take all such statements with a grain of_

_salt.”_

_Robert Collier_


_“Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.”_

_Theodore Roosevelt_


So here you are. You’ve busted your butt and written your book, created
your software, designed your service, or hung the sign on the door of your
coaching business. But you don’t have any testimonials yet.

Some people see this as a handicap they’ll never overcome. People get
hung up on this stuff because they see people using testimonials, feedback,
endorsements, and reviews in their sales copy, but they don’t have any yet.


97


Yes, testimonials can help you build momentum and improve the
effectiveness of your sales messages. But when you’re talking about sales
copy and the sales process, what you’re actually worried about here is
**proof** . When most people read your sales copy, at some point their brain
says, “Okay, sounds good. But why should I believe you? Will this work
for me? Has this worked for other people? Do I really need this?”

Lack of proof is the real reason why you think you need testimonials
and freak out if you don’t have any.

Testimonials usually come in sales copy after you have made your
claims and your offer. So, you’ve pulled them in with the headline. You’ve
aroused their curiosity with your fabulous bullets. You’ve given them the
information, and now all of a sudden it’s time to start thinking about
making that purchase decision. That’s when many people will say, “Well,
yeah, that sounds good, but I’ve heard this stuff before. Why should I
believe you?”

You need proof that what you’re talking about is significant and will
work for them. There are many different proof elements you can use
besides a product-specific testimonial.

In an ideal world, you would have a results-oriented testimonial which
is from someone who used your product, service, or software, etc. The
person got great results and are willing to say, “I used it. I got this result,
this result, and this result. It was awesome and changed my life and here’s
proof.”


98


Results-oriented testimonials are the types you want. But you have to
be careful, especially in the areas of health, finance, banking, investing,
and things like that. There are specific requirements for testimonials like
that. There are disclaimers and disclosures you need to provide (you can
investigate those on your own). But the authorities are particularly
concerned with any claims made about health or finances.

Bottom line: be careful and never manufacture a results-oriented

testimonial.

The next type of testimonial is about you and your company. These are
relatively easy to get. You just ask people you’ve done business with or
people who know you to provide a testimonial about you or your company
so you can have testimonials on your website. Simply ask them what they
would say to a friend or colleague about you and if it would be okay to put
that quote on your site. It’s that simple.

The next testimonial is a celebrity endorsement. The celebrity can be a
notable figure in your niche world.

For example, in 2001, when I published the e-book that launched me
into the online business arena, I received an endorsement from a
gentleman named Jay Conrad Levinson who wrote the Guerilla Marketing
books. I sent him a copy of the book, asked him if he’d say a couple of
words about it, and he endorsed it. That was huge! By the way, you’ve got
nothing to lose by asking people you don’t know if they’ll review your
product. Send it to some people recognized by your target audience and
see if they’ll endorse you. Most of them won’t, but you only need one or
two to say yes to change your life!

After celebrity endorsements, the next thing you can use is statistics
that support what you’re telling people. There are tons of studies and
statistics out there on anything you can imagine. Go to Google and enter
your topic plus the word “statistics” or “study.”

Here’s an example: We want to find some proof to support the sales
message for my book _Selling Your Home Alone_ . You would go to Google
and search for “for sale by owner statistics.” According to the National
Association of Realtors, nine out of ten for-sale-by-owners will fail, give
up, and list with a real estate agent within thirty days. So you can play that
up in the proof section and say, “The truth is, according to statistics, nine
out of every ten for-sale-by-owners will fail. Don’t let that be you. That’s
why you need this book!”

Leverage those statistics to give you the proof you need for the claims
you’re making.

You can also leverage quotes to help build your proof. Find some


99


quotes that apply to what you’re trying to get people to do or buy. Use
those quotes in the appropriate places to instill trust and to reinforce the
idea that to buy what you’re selling is a good decision.

So if you don’t have any testimonials yet, you now have a bunch of
different options for getting proof elements into your sales copy.

Let me tell you a quick story.
One of the things I did to get testimonials for my first book, _Selling_
_Your Home Alone_, was to give away copies of my book to people who
were trying to sell their houses themselves. I handed it to them and said,
“Here’s my book. I think it will help you. If it does, would you mind
giving me a testimonial? And please, let me know if you have any
questions I can help you with.”

That’s all I said to them. Results? I received many testimonial letters
for my book because I just gave it away and asked people to provide me
with a testimonial.

How do you put this secret in action? Don’t let the lack of testimonials
hold you up. If you don’t have results-oriented testimonials, then work
your way down the different options I’ve given you. Find one or more to
help you do what you need to do with proof.

The fastest way to get testimonials is to hand out something to different
people and ask for a testimonial or an endorsement either for the product,
for you, or for the topic in general.

Don’t let the lack of testimonials stop you. People get all worked up
and say stupid stuff like, “Oh, I don’t have any of these things, so I won’t
be able to sell.” That’s not true. Will results testimonials help you sell
more? More than likely, yes! But you can’t sell more until you’ve sold
some. And you can’t sell some until you get the damn thing up there and
offer it for sale in the first place!


Summary:

Don’t let lack of testimonials stop you.


You need proof to help them feel comfortable making the decision to
buy from you.


Proof comes in many forms, including celebrity endorsements,
statistics, and quotes that support your sales message.


Give your product away to people in exchange for an honest
testimonial.

# **Secret #15** **3 Sales Formulas That Never Fail**

_“If you don’t sell, it’s not the product that’s wrong, it’s you.”_

_Estee Lauder_


It is critical you understand Secret #8, your _Fred_, your avatar.


What are his problems?


What are his questions?


What are his roadblocks?


What are the results he wants?


Because if you don’t understand Fred, you won’t be able to use these
formulas. So you’ve got to put in the research. An hour or two of proper
research, understanding your _Fred_, and then following these three
formulas is going to pay off not once, not twice, but for the rest of your
life.

These formulas work for a 20-page sales letter, a one-minute video
sales letter commercial, and a 10-minute sales talk. They work anywhere
and everywhere for crafting sales messages.


101


### **Understanding how to structure a sales message.**

1. **Formula #1: Problem/Agitate/Solve.** This formula is my favorite

because you can use it for anything. You construct your sales
message in three parts:

a. You _define_ the problem they face
b. You _agitate_ it, make it worse, make it hurt

c. You _solve_ it by presenting your product or service as the solution


Now, the key is to make it worse. A LOT worse! _Agitate_ is the magic
in this formula, which works for a 20-page sales letter, a one-page
letter you might even send through the mail, or for an email. It works
anywhere. You meet them with the problem they face, but don’t leave
it alone.

.
**Let’s use dog aggression as our example**
**State the problem** : “Here’s the problem. If your dog barks or acts
like it’s going bite other people, this is something you need to get
under control quickly.”
**Agitate it.** “If you don’t, you could be subject to a lawsuit. Your dog
could mutilate a child. You could carry the guilt as well as the
financial burden of a single, instantaneous dog attack for the rest of
your life. So no matter how innocent, cuddly, and friendly your dog
is, if you don’t have them properly trained, it could cripple you
financially for the rest of your life.” Remember, agitating is the secret
sauce in this formula.
**Introduce the solution** . You can say, “Luckily for you, there’s now a
solution. _The Complete A-to-Z Puppy-Dog Training Guide_ helps you
not only with aggression, but also with potty training, learning tricks,
and socializing your dog to be a happy, healthy member of the


102


family.”
Boom. Whether that was a video sales letter directing somebody to a
website from an email, a social media post, or a Facebook Live event,
it doesn’t matter. That’s the formula: Problem/Agitate/Solve.
**Let’s look at another example: real estate flippers.**
**State the problem.** “You want to flip real estate, but so does
everybody else.”
**Agitate it.** “To make matters even worse, every time one of those
flipping seminars comes through town, a thousand people are fighting
to find the deals you’re out there every day trying to get. Which
means, not only is it harder for you to be able to find deals, but also
the deals you _do_ find are getting thinner because all these newbies are
willing to pay more money for these flips. So all the profit is gone out
of the deal before you can even make the deal.”
**Introduce the solution.** “Well, luckily for you, there’s now a
solution. It’s _The Hidden Flippers’ Detective_ which helps you find
the deals before they ever come on the market. It shows you how to
find deals, how to finance deals, how to get deals done before anyone
even knows there was a deal to be had.”
**Third example: marriage counseling.**
**State the problem.** “You and your spouse don’t talk the way you
used to, and it may just seem like things are a little weird right now.”
**Agitate it.** “But here’s the real problem you’re facing. If you don’t
reconnect now, statistics say there’s a high probability that you’ll end
up in a divorce. Even if you don’t, you’ll live unhappily day-to-day,
not with a lover, not with your best friend, but with a roommate. The
only reason you’re staying together is for the kids or to pay the
mortgage.”
**Introduce the solution.** “Well, luckily for you, there’s now a
solution, _The Marriage Revitalization Guide._ It helps you reconnect,
keep communication open, and learn to appreciate each other again. It
helps you reignite the fire that got you together in the first place.
You’ll become a team that takes on the world together. Get back to
how you felt about each other before you got married.”
Bam! Problem/Agitate/Solve. You can use it for anything and it
works especially well with cold traffic.


103


2. **Formula #2: If you want 3X benefit, then do this.** This is a positive

message bent. Use this when you’re focusing on the desire and not a
problem per se. You talk about benefit, benefit, and benefit, then
whatever action you want them to take.
**Let’s look at the dog training example.**
Instead of aggression, you want to teach your dog some cool tricks. It
would be fun to have a well-trained dog that can do cool tricks. “So if
you want to **train your dog**, **teach him some great tricks**, or even
just **have a lot more fun with your pet**, then you need to check out
_The 10 Tricks You Can Teach Your Dog In A Weekend_ course. Here’s
why . . .”
**Real estate investing.**
“If you want to **find great deals**, if you want to **find deals before**
**anybody else**, and you want to **create a steady stream of new deals**
**you don’t have to chase**, then you need to check out _Flippers’_
_Paradise_ . Here’s why . . .”
**Marriage counseling.**
“If you want to **reignite the fire with your spouse**, if you want to **get**
**back in touch with the feeling you had when you first got**
**married**, or you simply want to **reconnect with your best friend in**
**the world**, then check out _Marriage Revitalization Secrets_ . Here’s
why . . .”

This second formula is that simple and usually works well with hot
and warm traffic.


104


3. **Formula #3: The Before/After/Bridge** . This formula uses some

NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming—the study of how language
gets people to take action).


**a. Start with the before.** Talk about the way things are now.
Typically, there’s a problem, a question, a roadblock, or something in
the way that makes them unhappy.


105


**b. Introduce the after.** Tell them to imagine what their life will be
like. In NLP, this is referred to as _Future Pacing_ . “Imagine your life,
circumstances, business, marriage, or whatever, once the negative is
gone.” Once you’ve painted that picture where they’ve solved the
problem, answered the question, or removed the roadblock, they’ve
gone from unhappy to happy. Now it’s time to bridge your product to
this happy feeling.


**c. Bridge** . “Here’s the path to get there. Here’s the product. Here’s
the service. Here’s the method. Here’s how you’re going to bridge
that gap of where you are now to where you want to be.”


**Let’s look at our dog training example.**


106


**Start with before** . “Your dog’s not listening. You’re worried that
he’ll get loose and run down the street, maybe even run into traffic
and get hit. He might get in a fight with another dog. Or, he might
bite a neighbor’s child, which could lead to some serious legal
problems.”
**Introduce the after** . “Now, imagine what it would be like to have
your dog listen to you. Not because he’s scared of you but because he
loves you. He walks with you down the street without a leash. Your
dog does all kinds of fun tricks, and you enjoy your time together.
You’re not at all worried about your dog being aggressive or
exhibiting any other negative behavior towards other people. And
you’re extremely happy together and have a great relationship.”
**Bridge** . “Here’s how you get to that point. It’s called _Dog Training_
_Secrets_ which helps you get (this benefit), (this benefit), and (this
benefit). Here’s how . . .”


.
**Real estate investing**


**Start with before** . Let’s say your avatar has a question about finding
deals. “Here’s where you are right now. You can’t find deals before
everybody else does. You’re hitting the classified ads every day.
You’re looking at Craigslist every day. You’re pounding the
pavement and looking at for-sale-by-owner signs every day. But the
problem is everybody else is doing the same thing.”
**Introduce the after** . “Imagine what your real estate investing life
would be like if your phone was ringing off the hook with qualified
people asking you to do business with them. You have unlimited
sources of funding so you can do all the deals you ever wanted. You
can cherry-pick the best deals for yourself, refer the rest to other
investors, and get a finder’s fee from every single transaction.”
**Bridge** . “Let me show you how to do that. With _Flippers’ Paradise_,
you will be able to do (this), (this), and (this). Here’s what I
mean . . .”


.
**Marriage counseling**


**Start with before** . “Here’s the way things probably are right now.
They’re not too good; they’re not too bad. They just are. You and
your spouse pass each other in the hallway, you talk, you hug,
occasionally you make love. But overall, things aren’t the way they
used to be, and you’re starting to wonder why you are even together.”
**Introduce the after** . “Imagine what your life would be like if every


107


time you saw your spouse, you felt the same feelings you felt when
you first met? When you courted? When you dated? And when you
were together, it was the most special time you ever felt. You
couldn’t wait to see your spouse every night when you came home
from work. You couldn’t wait to spend time with them on the
weekend and do things together.”
**Bridge.** “Well, that doesn’t have to be a fantasy. It can be your
reality. And here’s how to get there.” Then you tell them how to
achieve their goal with your product, service, etc. as the bridge to get
them there.
3. This formula can work with all traffic temperatures!


Those are the three formulas. Where can you use them? Anywhere and
for any purpose where you want to start selling. Use them in tweets. Use
them in blog posts. Use them in social media updates or email teasers.
These formulas work wherever you want to start the sales process.


Summary:

These three sales formulas just plain work!


These formulas take people through a mental process that sets them
up to buy.


Test each formula to find the one that works best with your audience.

# **Secret #16** **It’s All Ice Cream, But What Flavor Should I** **Choose?**

_“You can have everything you want in life if you will help enough people get what_

_they want.”_

_Zig Ziglar_


When it comes to sales letters, you might ask, “What should I use: a video
sales letter, a long sales letter, or a short sales letter? Which do you think is
best?” Some people think that length matters.

To answer this question, I’ll give you the personal answer followed by
my professional answer.

### **Personal Answer**


Start with a video sales letter. Why? For me, it’s the fastest way to get
an offer up when I want to test an idea, to sell something, to make an offer,
or to launch a new funnel. Any time I go into the marketplace, a video
sales letter is the fastest way for me to do this.


109


Here’s how I structure the page.


Start with the headline. Seems obvious, doesn’t? But as we discussed
in Secret #6, the headline is your most important piece of sales copy.


Insert your video.


Add a Buy button, placed right under the video.


In some cases, I will stop right here. In others, I’ll add the following:


Add 4-6 awesome, curiosity-inducing bullets under the buy button.


Give the guarantee.


Summarize what they’ll get.


Insert another Buy button.


Closing copy.


The Postscript (P.S.). Restate the main benefits stated in the video
sales letter.


Now, it causes some people heartburn to have the video play
automatically. In fact, there are an ever-increasing number of people
online who rebel against videos playing automatically, and Google’s
Chrome browser has basically put the kibosh on auto-playing videos with
the sound turned on.

Then, typically, we have a Buy button right under the video, followed
by three to six bullets about the product, the software, the service
underneath that. We sometimes flip those two, where we may have the
video and then the bullets and then the Buy button, but typically my Buy
button is going right underneath the video.

We have the guarantee and we have the summary of what they’re going
to get. So literally, in the summary we list off that they’re going to get this,
this, this, this, this, this, this, this and this (in a bulleted list). Then we have
another Buy button. Finally, we have the close, and then probably a P.S.
The P.S. basically just restates the main benefits expressed in the video
sales letter itself.

That’s the pattern I use for anything under a couple of hundred bucks.
Why this pattern?


1. It’s quick. A video sales letter is a one-day project if you have the

right tools and knowledge.


110


2. It’s easy for people to digest. You run traffic to it, see how people

react to it, and watch the results in sales, opt-ins, clicks, or whatever
the objective is for your sales copy.


Does that mean long-form sales letters are dead? Absolutely not. Do
not believe anybody who heralds the end of long-form sales letters. I still
use them because they are effective.


Then why use the long copy if you start with video sales letters? You
use the long copy to sell a higher priced item and if people need more
information to make a purchase decision.

In my experience, nobody wants to watch an hour-long video sales
letter. They’ll attend an hour-long webinar, but they won’t view a lengthy
video sales letter. So, in some cases, you have to give people more
information using long copy.

In a case involving higher priced stuff, they typically need more
information, especially if it’s a more technical sale. You have to give them
more data so they can make a decision. This preference isn’t a hard-andfast rule. I know somebody who sells a $5,000 coaching program using an
eight-minute video and no application process. You pay or don’t pay at the
end of the video.

Typically, the two reasons you use long copy are when what you’re


111


selling costs more, or people need more information to make a decision.

So in this case, typically what we’ll do is start with a headline. We’ll
still do a sales video. Then we have the Buy button and then we have the
long-form sales letter underneath all of that. So just because you’re using
the long-form sales letter doesn’t mean that you don’t use the video too.

By the way, it’s okay if the long-form sales letter duplicates what you
share in the video sales letter. In fact, I’ve actually seen where the video
sales letter and the long-form sales letter were the exact same thing. The
long-form sales letter was basically just a transcript of the video sales
letter. Or, in other cases, the long-form sales letter was basically the script
used to create the video sales letter.

Why would you want to have both the video and the long-form sales
letter on the same page? Because people either watch the video, or they
read the long-form copy. Also, let’s say somebody’s at work or in a
situation where they can’t or don’t want to listen. They will read the copy.
Some will even print it to read it offline. Some people want to read; some
people want to watch. Some people will do both. In fact, some people will
watch the video and then read the sales letter before they decide to buy or

not.

When would you use a short-form sales letter? Typically, you would
use it to sell something relatively inexpensive. You don’t need a 30-minute
video sales letter or a 30-page sales letter to sell something for 15 or 20
bucks. Typically, you’re overselling if you use a longer sales message in
those cases, and people can get suspicious.

You can also use a shorter sales letter or sales video with something
that doesn’t require a lot of explanation, such as a physical product.
Simply hold it up in the sales video and say, “Hey, look. This is what I
have. This is what it does. These are the benefits to you. Here’s why you
should buy this now.”

Using a short sales letter makes sense when it’s inexpensive and
doesn’t require a lot of explanation. If you did write longer copy, someone
would say, “They’re over-selling this product. Something is going on
here.”

Bottom line: My first option in 99.99% of the cases is a video sales
letter.

### **Professional answer**


Test which works better: a video sales letter, a long-form sales letter, or
a short-form sales letter.


112


A word of caution: be careful of the _absolute experts_ . These are people
who tell you that something is only one way. Nobody knows for sure about
anything until you test a video sales letter versus a long-form sales letter
versus a short-form sales letter. Which type of sales copy to use is as much
art as it is science for your specific audience.

The truth is, when people sell something, they find patterns that work
for them and produce results. They assume the way they did it is always
going to get results. Then they tell others this is the absolute only way to
do it.

Let me give you an example. There was an internet guru who said red
headlines don’t work anymore. At the time, people believed your headline
should be in red. But he told everybody, “Red headlines don’t work
anymore; your headline should be blue.”

So everybody changed their headline colors to blue. And what
happened? Many people’s conversion rates went down. A few people
tested red versus blue headlines (I was one of them) and found that red
headlines out-performed the blue headlines on many of our sales

messages.

Taken over thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands of
visits, the difference was remarkable. Those who didn’t do any testing of
this theory lost money because they took someone else’s word for it that
one way was better than another.

Learning patterns and formulas is good. But the only way to know what
works is to test the different variants and see which one works best for
your audience, traffic, and offer.

When you fall into a pattern because you did it before and got good
results, be careful. That’s when “good enough” kills your results. I have to
be cautious of this all the time. When you keep doing it the same way and
don’t test, you end up potentially leaving a ton of money on the table.

One more example: Up-sells or one-time offers (offers made after the
initial sale as part of a “sales funnel” to increase the overall profit per
customer). I do these consistently now. Why? Because after ten years of
selling the same product, I added a one-time offer to it, and immediately
saw a 30% increase in profits. When that happened, I wanted to slam my
head in a car door. Why? Because I saw the sales jump from the one-timeoffer, mentally went backward ten years, and calculated all the money I
had left on the table (to the tune of $980,000 over the years).

Bottom line: test to see if a video sales letter is going to work better
than the alternatives. I recommend you start with a video sales letter using
the above format. But you need to test what ultimately works best for you


113


and your audience, so you know for sure what gets you the best results.


Summary:

If in doubt, start with a video sales letter.


In the end, you have to test long vs. short vs. video to find the best
option.


Beware of anyone who deals in absolutes when it comes to sales
copy. The only way to know anything for sure is to test.


Beware of falling into the trap of only doing things one way,
especially if you’ve gotten “good” results from it in the past.


114


# **Secret #17** **How To Write An Amazing Sales Letter—** **FAST**

_“The only purpose of advertising is to make sales. It is profitable or unprofitable_

_according to its actual sales.”_

_Claude Hopkins_


Want to write an amazing sales letter fast? Then you need to learn the
thirteen parts of a sales letter. I like to think of those thirteen parts as
Legos, stacked one on top of another.

In this case, though, you go from the top down instead of from the
bottom up when creating your letter. By focusing on the thirteen different
parts, you don’t feel the pressure to write an entire sales letter. All you do


115


is create each of these parts in turn which makes it easier to complete.

Doing thirteen small steps is more attainable than doing one giant sales
message project. You can spread these out as you have time, especially if
you’re a part-time entrepreneur.

Here’s the key concept: The job of each part is to move people on to
the next part of the sales letter.

Think of your sales letter as stepping stones across a stream. One stone
leads to the next, to the next, and to the next. If you miss one, then
someone’s going to get wet and not make it to the other side where they
will buy!

Another way to think about this is like an old fire bucket brigade. The
fire truck pulls up with just a barrel of water. Then ten, fifteen, or twenty
firemen pass the bucket filled with water one by one to the next person in
line. If one of those firemen go down or gets out of line, the whole thing
stops working and the building burns to the ground.

Bottom line: think about each of these parts in order, taking their turn
passing the bucket.

### **Headline**


The first thing is your headline package, which can consist of a preheadline, headline, and sub-headline.

Example:
_Attn: All Funnel Hackers_

### **_How To Get ALL Of Your Sales Letters, Scripts, And Webinar_** **_Slides Written (In Under 10 Minutes) WITHOUT Hiring An_** **_Expensive Copywriter!_**


_(This Works Even If You HATE Writing And Never Want To Know_

_ANYTHING About Copywriting!)_

Just remember, the purpose of the headline is to attract attention from
the right people.

Then, if you think about an actual letter, it’s going to say something
like “From the desk of,” your name, and regarding the topic.

Example:
_From the Desk of Jim Edwards_
_Re: How to solve all your sales copy problems at the click of a button_


116


What have we done in that headline package? We’ve grabbed their
attention, told them who the letter’s from, and also told them what this
letter is about in just a few words.

Now, in a video sales letter, what matters most are the first words that
come out of your mouth.

Example:

_Do you need to write an amazing sales letter? Hi, my name’s Jim_
_Edwards. In the next couple of minutes I’m going to show you how to_
_write great sales copy fast._


Your headline in a video sales letter or a spoken script are those first
couple of sentences. So the first part grabbed their attention, then you
identified yourself, and finally you let them know what to expect.

### **Shocking Statement**


The second block is a shocking statement. Most people operate in a
hypnotic state. They barely pay attention to what you’re saying or what
they’re seeing or reading. Their mind is distracted by things like, “I should
go check out Facebook;” “Hey, I wonder what’s going on over on
Twitter;” “Hey, I wonder what’s for dinner tonight.”

All these distractions assault their brains. Your job is to shock them, so
they stop what they’re doing and pay attention to you. You do this with a
shocking statement or image. Now, it doesn’t have to be something like,
“Hey, let me flash you. Let me open up my trench coat,” type thing. That
would work for some sites! But in this case, a shocking statement might be
something that goes against something they hold true or expose something
they suspect is true.

Use a “Did you know?” statement.
For example:
_Did you know most people who try to write a sales letter fail_
_miserably? It’s true. Some even go bankrupt and lose their houses!_


What?


Here’s another:
_Did you know the number one reason people get turned down for_
_military service is not due to a criminal record but because they’re_
_considered too fat to train?_


117


And another:
_Did you know that 99% of the people who start writing a book never_
_finish, and they carry that regret like a 50-pound chain around their_
_neck for the rest of their lives?_


Holy Crap. I better pay attention.


Now, here’s a cool tip: Remember that research I showed you in Secret
#14 to use if you don’t have any testimonials? Well, often in that research,
you’ll find some cool information you can use for “ _did you know”_

statements.

Here are some examples for my for-sale-by-owner book. (I looked up
“for sale by owner statistics” on Google just now.)

_Did you know that nine out of every_ ten for-sale-by-owners _are going to_
_fail miserably and end up listing with a realtor within 30 days?_


_Did you know the average for-sale-by-owner sells for over $59,000_ _**less**_
_than homes sold by realtors?_


Oh, crap!


That’s the reaction you want your reader or listener to have. You want
them to STOP what they’re doing and pay attention to every word you’re
sharing.

### **Define the Problem**


Defining the problem uses a formula called _Problem, Agitate, Solve,_
which we discussed in detail in Secret #15. Are there other formulas? Yes.
Is this the easiest one to do? Absolutely. Is this the one that will most
likely make you the most money quickly? You bet.

When you define the problem, you tell them in no uncertain terms the
exact problem they face.

_Here’s the problem you face ___________._


You can use that exact wording and fill in the blank. You state it in no
uncertain terms.

Here’s an example from the military fitness niche:
_Here’s the problem you face: as a society, we’ve become so sedentary_
_that young people don’t know how to get into shape and stay there._


Here’s an example from the author niche:


118


_Here’s the problem you face: most people think that writing a book is_
_so hard and takes so long they can’t imagine becoming an author._

### **Agitate**


You’ve told them the problem, but that’s not good enough. You want to
make it hurt because, the more it hurts, the more they need a solution and
are willing to pony up with their time, money, and attention to solve it.

If you leave it at the problem stage, they’ll say, “Well, I’m not _that_ fat.”
Or, “I will finish my book when I get a chance.” And then they lay their
heads back down on the sofa, turn up _The Maury Show_, gorge on Cheesie
Poofs, and never write their book.


_**“They don’t buy if it don’t hurt!” Jim Edwards**_


This step is where you pour on the _pain_ . You make it worse by using a
statement like, “which means you _____.”

Notice this is the _same_ statement used to elicit emotion in the Secret #9:
The Ultimate Bullet Formula. However, instead of evoking a positive
feeling, in this case, we use it to crush their soul!

Examples:
_Which means you’ll never get a chance to serve in the armed forces_
_and serve your country._


_Which means you’ll struggle with being a fat couch potato for the rest_
_of your life and never live up to your full potential._
_Which means you’ll never share your message with the world and when_
_you die, your message dies with you._


You want them to say “Oh dang! That hurts. That stings. Okay, you got
my attention. All right. I don’t want to die like that. Save me now!”

This process does _not_ have to take pages. It’s a one-two punch in a bar
fight they didn’t know they were having! You smack somebody in the
mouth hard enough, you’ve got their attention. You don’t have to hit them
again.

### **Present The Solution**


Now you introduce them to your product or service that holds the
solution they need to the problem you just made worse in the last step.


119


Once you’ve smacked them in the mouth and made it worse, say,
“Luckily for you, there’s now a solution. Let me introduce you to _____.”

Examples:
_Luckily for you, there’s now a solution. Let me introduce you to the_ PT
Test Survival Guide _, a brand new book to help everyone pass their next_
_PT test._
_Luckily for you, there’s now a solution. Let me introduce you to_ The
Seven Day E-book _, the revolutionary course that helps anyone write_
_and publish their own book or e-Book in less than a week, starting from_
_scratch._


That’s all you have to do.
You introduce the solution with “Let me introduce you to ______.”
_Let me introduce you to my new coaching program._
_Let me introduce you to an incredible piece of software that writes all_
_your sales copy for you._
_Let me introduce you to a quick-read book that will change your real_
_estate investing life forever._


Whatever your thing is, this will work.

### **Use Bullets To Arouse Curiosity**


This sixth block uses bullets to arouse curiosity. (See how everything
you’ve been learning so far is coming together?) Once you’ve introduced
the solution, take your features, benefits, and meanings and use them to
build curiosity and desire for your solution.

How many bullets do you need? In my opinion, for most purposes, you
need about six, eight, or ten rock-solid bullets. Nobody wants to read a
hundred bullets. They need to see your six, eight, or ten best bullets. Am I
saying you’ll never use a massive list of bullets? No. But in the workaday
world of sales copy, ten solid bullets pull the weight of fifty mediocre

ones.

If you want to get good at bullets fast, review Secret #9: The Ultimate
Bullet Formula.

### **Credibility Statement About You**


Tell people about you and why you are qualified to bring them this
solution. Again, depending on what piece of copy you’re creating, this


120


could be one sentence or a whole page listing your education,
qualifications, and how you got to be where you are today. It depends on
the length and purpose of your sales message.

If you need a long sales letter to sell a high-ticket item, where the sales
copy carries the entire weight of the purchase decision, people will want to
know the who, what, where, when, why and how of your qualifications to
bring them this solution.

On the flip side, the guy who invented _The Perfect Push Up_ and _The_
_Perfect Pull Up_ covered this credibility statement in a one-minute
infomercial by saying, “invented by a Navy SEAL.” Those five words
were enough to establish all the credibility he needed to sell $100 million
of fitness equipment.

Bottom line: answer the question, “Why you?”

### **Proof**


Proof answers the question “Why should I believe you?” Use your
testimonials and endorsements now. Use whatever you have at this point
(statistics, quotes, government studies, etc.) to establish proof.

It’s easy to introduce this by saying, _“But don’t just take my word for it._
_Take a look at this.”_ That’s always a great segue into this section.

One type of proof we haven’t talked about is pictures or graphics.
Images are one of the best forms of evidence, but they are also one of the
most regulated. Why? Photos are compelling but are also easy to fake.
Think about weight loss. The before and after picture is super powerful.
Many of those pictures are fake. A dirty little secret is that the before (fat)
picture is actually the _after_ picture. In other words, people grab an old
image of themselves when they were skinny, take a picture of themselves
now as heavy, and then flip the pics. Nasty little trick! By the way, don’t
do this.

If you’re making an income claim, you could show pictures of bank
statements. People show pictures of checks all the time, especially in real
estate investment sales copy. People will show pictures of people with
whom they’ve done business.

My best advice: always tell the truth and back it up. If someone said,
“Hey, you need to prove this is real in a court of law!” could you do it?

### **Sum Up The Offer And Give Price**


121


In this section, tell them exactly what they’re going to get, how they’re
going to get it, when they’re going to get it, and how much it costs.

Coaching Example:


This is a six-part coaching program that starts on this date


It will be delivered weekly


There will be time for Q&A


Drill Example:


18-Volt Drill


Comes with bonus 20-piece drill and driver set


Delivered via UPS and arrives in 3-4 days


Whatever it is, tell them exactly what they’re going to get, when they’re
going to get it, how they’re going to get it, and how much it costs.

Let’s talk about pricing here. Some people who say you should do a
dramatic price drop when you reveal the price. In some cases, people are
immune to that, especially if you are _not_ selling in-person or on a webinar.

For instance, in a text ad or on a web page where you aren’t present to
close the deal, if you tell somebody, “Regularly, this is $399.00, but today
you’re going to get it for $2.50!” that’s not going to work. Their BS
detector goes off before they finish reading the sentence.

To see great examples of price drops for everyday product sales, look
on Amazon. Virtually every single product they sell will have a regular
price that’s crossed out, and there’s a reduced price. It’s usually
somewhere around a 10% to 30% discount. Also, look at the colors they
use and how they cross out prices, etc.

You can say, “Regularly it is this price, but right now it’s just this.”
You want people to feel like they’re getting a great deal, and this is the
place to do it.

**Warning:** Usually, those who live by the price die by the price. If the
whole justification for buying what you sell is a low price, you’ll rarely
make money. Provide value pricing, but don’t fall into _commodity_ pricing
where the price alone wins the battle. The cheapest guy in town rarely
makes money (unless he’s got one hell-of-a-back-end funnel)!

### **Bonuses And Pot Sweeteners**


122


If you have bonuses, special savings, extra service included, or
anything else to put them over the top, this is where you tell them about it.

In this section, you add more value to the offer. Maybe you throw in an
extra something like a bonus report, an individual consultation with you,
or anything that will make them feel like they are getting a fantastic deal
on your offer. Be sure to build up the value of the bonuses and show why
they are such a valuable addition to the offer.

Marlon Sanders, a man I deeply respect, told me something that caught
my attention and has stayed with me for going on twenty years now. While
standing in a hotel lobby in Boulder, Colorado in February 2001, he said,
“Jim, the easiest thing in the world is to _sell dollars for dimes_ .” To
increase the effectiveness of your offer, you pile on the bonuses until the
total value of your offer is 10X the price you charge. That was cool advice.

Then Marlon said something that changed my life. To this day, I
remember the Lipton tea bag tag hanging out of the side of his teacup as
we stood there talking while all the attendee’s at the event filed back into
the meeting room. He and I were the only ones standing there when he
dropped this knowledge bomb on me.

“Jim, if you really want to make your offer amazing, take your
competitor’s USP (unique selling proposition) and turn it into a free bonus
with offer.”
_your_

In other words, whatever your competitors are offering that makes them
unique, provide the same thing as a free bonus when people buy from you.
That way, instead of comparing you to your competitors and trying to
decide between the two offers, they buy from you because they see
themselves getting everything they want without having to buy from
anyone but you!

I could write an entire book on what that has meant to me over almost
the last two decades, but I’ll tell you what I immediately did with that new
idea.

I was selling a mortgage education product that was doing okay. My
main competitors at the time were mortgage software calculators. So I
went and found a piece of mortgage calculator software I could buy the
rights to and started including it as a _free_ bonus with my offer. I told
people they didn’t have to buy a calculator from anyone else because I was
giving one for free. My sales took off, and I never looked back.

CAUTION: Don’t pile on a bunch of crap bonuses for the sake of
piling on bonuses. Be strategic about it. Use those bonuses to create an
offer that makes so much sense and feels so right people would be insane
to say no.


123


### **Guarantee**

The guarantee is where you take away the risk. Again, it could be a
paragraph or a single sentence. You could simply say 30-Day No
Questions Asked Guarantee. You might also do a guarantee where you
restate every single one of the benefits you sold them on before.

Example:
_Not only do we guarantee this unconditionally for 30 days, but if it_
_doesn’t show you exactly how to pass your next PT test, if it doesn’t_
_help you to get in shape in the next two weeks, if it doesn’t give you a_
_plan to get ready if you’re not ready right now, we don’t want your_
_money. We’ll give it all back. No questions asked. No hard feelings._


Again, whichever way you do it, this is the time to take away all the
risk.

### **Call Them To Action**


You’ve told your buyer everything they need to know about the
product. It’s time to call them to action.

It could be a button that says, “Click here to buy now!” At this point,
you can also give them another reason to buy right now. “When you order
today, we’ll give you another 10% off as part of a special marketing test.”

If it’s a big, long sales letter, you may recap all they’ll get in a short
bullet format.


You’re going to get the DVDs


You’re going to get the one-on-one coaching


You’re going to get instant access to the online training


You’re going to get the push-button software


You’re going to get the audiobook version


You’re going to get all my blueprints and templates


How you do this depends on what you’re selling, what type and
quantity of sales copy you’re using, and where you are using it.

### **Postscript (P.S.)**


124


The final part of your sales letter is the P.S. This is where you restate
the benefits and tell them again to act now.

By the way, where did the P.S. come from?
Back when people wrote letters with quill pens or typed letters on
typewriters, nobody wanted to rewrite or retype a whole letter if they
forgot to include something important. That’s where the postscript came
from. It is the vital stuff you forgot to put in the letter, but you aren’t going
to retype the whole thing!

Here is where you restate the main benefits, the reason they should act
now, and then you tell them to buy now!

Example:
_P.S. This gem will sell for $49. This introductory price of $29 is a “Buy_
_it now before it’s gone” offer, so act fast!_
_P.P.S. Let’s be blunt: If you pass on this offer, in a week from today_
_will you have an e-book written or not? Probably not!_
_You’ll still wish and want it, but you won’t write it or make money from_
_it. Face it. Most of what you need is instruction and encouragement._
_Get this book_ _**now**_
_and have your e-book as fast as one week from_
_**today**_ _! Wouldn’t you like to be making money and bragging about your_
_passive income within a week?_
_Act now! Buy now! Your satisfaction is guaranteed. Click here!_


125


This thirteen-step sales message formula will work for a ten-page sales
letter or a one-page direct mail sales letter. Whether it’s written on paper,
displayed on the web, or delivered through video, these are the parts you
must hit in the order given.

By following this thirteen-step process, you’ve addressed all their
objections. You’ve solved all their issues by walking them through this
psychological process of evaluating whether to buy or not. Each of these
sections could be pages, paragraphs, sentences, or a few words. Remember
to hit all the points, in order, if you want to make more sales.


Summary:

The sales letter is like stepping stones across a pond—leave one out
and you’re going to stumble and get wet.


This process works for a one-page letter, a video, or a twenty-page
letter.


Remember to stack up the value if you want people to buy from you.

# **Secret #18** **How To Write Killer Email Teasers—FAST**

_“Good advertising is written from one person to another. When it is aimed at_

_millions it rarely moves anyone.”_

_Fairfax M. Cone_


What is an email teaser?


An email teaser is an email that gets sent to either a single customer or a
list of customers. You can send the teaser to your list, or you can entice an
affiliate or friend to send it out to their customers and subscribers. **Ninety-**
**nine times out of a hundred, the sole purpose of that email teaser is to**
**get the reader to click a link in the email itself and go to a web page.**

The ability to write a great email teaser can make a huge difference in


127


your business. The good news is, it’s simpler than you might think. Once
you understand the whole purpose of an e-mail teaser is to get somebody
to click on a link in that email and go to a web page, your life gets a lot
easier!

Most people make the mistake of selling the offer in the email teaser.
Don’t! Your sales letter or video sales letter will sell them.

The email teaser has one purpose: to get them to click to the website so
they can:


Read your sales message


Watch your sales video


Absorb your content


Read your blog posts


Watch your content video (which in turn refers them to your sales
website)


The only purpose of an email teaser is to get a click and to prepare the
viewer for what they will see once they click.

Once you understand that, it’s real simple.

### **There are only a few parts to a great email.**


The first part is the subject line. The subject line serves the same
purpose for an email as the headline serves on your sales message. Bottom
line: If the subject line sucks, no one’s going to open your email. If nobody
opens your email, nobody reads it. If nobody reads it, you don’t make any
money. It’s that simple.

So work on your subject line! The best subject lines I’ve found are
short, concise, and often phrased in the form of a question.

Let’s look at my buddy Stew with the PT testing examples:


_Worried about failing your next PT test?_


_Failed your last Pt test?_


_PT test coming up?_


These subject lines will get the right people to open up the email and
frankly, will not interest people who won’t buy anyway.

Once they open your email teaser, make sure to acknowledge them


128


rather than making them feel like this is an email a million other people are
getting too. That’s why I like to make sure I’m using an email software
program where I can use the person’s first name and fill it in, so the email
starts with “Hey, Craig. Hey, Bob. Hey, Mary.”

If I can’t do that, then I put in something like, “Hey everyone,” or “Hi
Fellow Funnel Hacker,” or something like that. Make people feel like
they’re part of the group and being acknowledged. You always need to
have some salutation to start it off. Don’t just dive right in.

Then you want to hit them with a shocking statement. There it is again,
something to pop the reader out of their hypnosis. Something like:


_Hey Craig,_


_Got a great new video for you_


_Got an exciting new announcement_


_Got something that’s going to blow your mind_


_Cool new, free webinar on (fantastic topic)_


You can also ask a question to start your teaser and shock them out of
hypnosis.


_Did you know that most people who try and write a book fail?_


_What happens if you fail your next PT test?_


_Did you know that 99 out of a 100 people who try to write a book_
_fail?_


Once you have their attention, hit them with three or four bullets to
arouse curiosity. Then tell them to click the link.

Example:
_Subject: Want to be a published author?_
_Hey Craig,_
_Did you know that 99 out of a 100 people who try to write a book fail?_
_Yep. It sucks. The main reasons why they fail are:_


_They don’t know how to create content that sells._


_They don’t know how to get it formatted._


_They don’t know how to publish it._


_The cool news is I have a great new video that shows you exactly how_


129


_to solve all those problems—_ _**fast**_ _and easy!_
_Click here right now to see it._
_LINK_

_I’ll see you over there._
_Thanks,_
_Jim_


That’s it.
Remember: In 99 out of 100 emails, the only purpose is to get them to
click a link.

One of the most successful email teasers I ever sent to my own list of
prospects was only a few lines.


_Subject: This blew me away_
_Hey Craig,_
_This was totally unexpected._
_Somebody just did a review and it’s amazing!_
_You’ve got to check this out._
_LINK_

_See you over there,_
_Jim_


That was the whole email. It sent the reader to a review someone did on
a product of mine. That was it, and people were swept up in the curiosity
of it. You have to be careful with this, so you don’t appear misleading.
Obviously, you wouldn’t use this type of thing with people who don’t
know who you are (again, that email above was sent to my own in-house
list).

A great email teaser breaks down like this:


Great subject line


Salutation


Shocking statement


Two, three, or four bullets or 2-4 sentences to build curiosity


Specific call to action for what you want them to do


Close with a personal note like “Hey, I’ll see you over there. Thanks,
Jim.”


That’s it.


130


Can you do it a bunch of different ways? Yes.
Is what I just outlined for you the shortcut way to do it? Absolutely,
and it’s going make your life a lot easier if you keep it concise. If you must
err on the side of one or the other, go with a shorter email as opposed to a
longer one.

Remember, you’re pumping up the benefits of what they will see, _not_
of what you’re selling.

Just like an e-mail teaser should be short, this is a quick secret with all
you need to remember:


Get their attention to get them to open the email


Acknowledge them


Use a shocking statement


Provide two, three, or four bullets to build up curiosity


Give a specific call to action


Close with “I’ll see you over there” and your name


That’s it, and it works in virtually any situation.
When you consider that 40 - 60% and more of your readers might see
this message on a mobile device, this is even more important. They don’t
want to read a ton of text. But if they can get the basic idea and you get
them excited or curious, they’ll click over to check out your sales letter,
video, or whatever it is.

Keep it short and sweet.
Here’s one final thought about email. Email is a personal way to
communicate because it arrives in their inbox. Therefore, they feel like
they know you. So the more you talk to them in the quick, familiar
language of a friend, the better your results.

Remember: Friends don’t send friends ten-page sales letters in email!


Summary:

99 times out of 100 the only purpose of your email is to get a click
from the right person.


Keep it short, concise, and aimed at getting the click.


Grab their attention and build their curiosity to entice them to click.


Though you may send that email to a million people, remember this:
they will read it one person at a time.


131


Write like you’re emailing a friend or colleague.


132


# **Secret #19** **The Hardest Draft You’ll Ever Write**

_“There is a secret every professional artist knows that the amateurs don’t: being_

_original is overrated. The most creative minds in the world are not especially_

_creative; they’re just better at rearrangement.”_

_Jeff Goins_


Of course, the hardest draft is the first draft. There’s never a perfect time to
write copy. There’s always something you’d probably rather be doing.
Often, when you sit down to write copy, you tell yourself you need it in
the next ten minutes. So, you sit down at the computer, turn it on, open
your word processor, and stare at the blinking cursor. Blink. Blink. Blink.
Blink.


133


You think, “How in the world am I going to go from this blank screen
to a sales message, a headline, a sales letter, or a video sales letter script?
How in the world am I going to do that?”

The answer is to think and write in chunks. Going back to Secret #17, a
sales letter is nothing more than a series of pieces. Don’t think, “Hey, I
have to write a sales letter.” Instead, think through the chunks needed to
create whatever it is you need.

In the case of a sales letter, first you need a headline. Then you need a
couple of bullets followed by an introduction. Then you do the _Problem,_
_Agitate, Solve_ formula. Next, write a description of your product followed
by some bullets explaining the benefits. Next, tell them a little bit about
yourself. Now, provide the proof that what you’re telling them works.
What bonuses can you add to sweeten the pot? Next, build up the value,
name the price, and then give a price drop. Now clearly state your call to
action. It’s time now to summarize your fantastic offer and conclude the
letter. Don’t forget the P.S. where you briefly restate everything and send
them back to the call to action.

Yes, that’s a bunch of parts, but when you think about it as parts instead
of as a giant whole, then it’s more manageable.

An email also has chunks. They are a subject line, salutation, _Problem,_
_Agitate, Solve_ formula with the actual solution waiting on the other side of
clicking the link in the email.

A video sales letter is nothing but a series of chunks. It’s your grabber
on the front, a _Problem, Agitate, Solve_ formula, the solution, five cool


134


bullets about the solution, three reasons to act now, and a call to action.

The hardest draft you’ll write is the first draft. That’s why you want to
use your swipe file to stimulate yourself and your creativity. Your swipe
file provides models for copy that works. Don’t look at a blank sheet. See
how you can adapt sales letters you’ve written before, sales letters other
people have written, headlines other people have written, bullets other
people have written, and calls to action other people have written.

Use your swipe file to get your mind going. The first draft is why we
invented [www.FunnelScripts.com. With Funnel Scripts all you do is fill](http://www.FunnelScripts.com)
out an online form, whack a button and then copy and paste. It takes away
the “blinking cursor” on a blank page and makes writing sales copy as
easy as answering some questions. Once you get something down on
paper, it’s a hundred times easier to edit and rewrite than it is to write from
scratch. Once you see it on paper or your screen, your mind puts it all
together and says, “I should say this; I shouldn’t say that. Let’s move this
here and that there. Oh, we need to have a guarantee. Oh, we should show
a picture here. Oops, we need to have this here and that there.”

Remember that all sales copy jobs are combinations of building blocks
or chunks. A sales letter is a headline package, your sales story, some
bullets, a guarantee, and your call to action. Are there other little parts in
there? Of course, but if you think about these main building blocks, it
takes away the anxiety of writing a big sales letter.

Your number one job when creating a piece of sales copy is to get the
first draft or version done as fast as you can. That is the key to your

success.


Summary:

Get the first draft done as fast as you can.


Use your swipe file to help you get it done instead of creating from
scratch.


Once you have the first draft it’s a hundred times easier to edit than it
is to write.

# **Secret #20** **Make ‘Em More Thirsty**

_“Decide the effect you want to produce in your reader.”_

_Robert Collier_


You’ve probably heard the saying, “You can lead a horse to water, but you
can’t make him drink.” That is true. In fact, you can take a Chihuahua
outside to go potty, but you can’t make her pee. You can bring someone to
a specific point to do what you want them to do, but you can’t force them
to do it. However, you can make that person more “thirsty” for what
you’re selling.

So the question becomes “How can I create content that makes people
want to buy without giving away so much they don’t need to buy?” For
people who sell digital products and services, this is important. In fact, it is
essential for anybody who sells anything. What you need to do is get
people positioned to buy from you, but you also need to make them more
“thirsty” so they buy faster.

Here is a distinction you have probably never heard before.
You’ve most likely heard the saying “stories sell.” However, I’ve found
stories make people “thirsty”, but sales copy tells them where to buy a


136


drink. Now I want you to think about that for just a second.

Stories make people “thirsty”. Then your sales copy tells them where to
go to buy a drink.

### **There are four different types of stories you tell people.**


When we’re thinking about content for your blog or social media and
sales copy stories you use on a sales letter or in a video, there is no
difference between them. It is your intention that makes the difference.

First, stories can be actual stories you tell about your life, your
business, other people, or anything that illustrates your point.

Second, stories can be case studies, which are stories about how
somebody got a result. It has a beginning, middle, and end. For instance: I
was here, I wasn’t happy, this is what I did with the product and these are
the results I got. It’s a three act play. It’s just like the hero’s journey. I was
here, I had a problem, this fixed it and this is where my life is now.

Third, examples can be stories as well. This is showing people how
something works, how something was applied, how something was put
into motion, and then the results they got.

Fourth, you can use what I call _**The Three M’s of Content**_, which are
pure gold that could potentially change your life. People are always
looking for ways to give valuable content that doesn’t completely solve a
problem, yet creates the need for what you are selling and increases the
urgency to buy right now.

The first **M** stands for dispelling a **myth** . People believe many myths.
You can create massive amounts of content, such as blog posts, articles,
videos, and entire webinars. In fact, whole books are written around myths
people believe and the debunking of those myths.

The second **M** stands for **misconception** . Myths are basically untruths
people believe, whereas misconceptions involve incorrect ideas about
something. You can clear up misconceptions—including false beliefs—
and replace them with correct views and clear understanding.

The third **M** stands for **mistakes** . Mistakes are where you point out
where other people are going wrong. Mistakes are the most powerful of
the three because nobody wants to make a mistake. Since we were little
kids, we’ve believed if you make a mistake you’re going to get a bad grade
on your paper, you’re going to lose a point on your test, or you’re going to
feel stupid. No adult wants to look stupid, so they will do anything to
avoid mistakes.

You can create stories around myths, misconceptions, and mistakes,


137


without providing any solution that is part of your product. However,
when you create stories with the _Three M’s of Content_, people will feel
like you have been spilling the beans all day long.

And, as a bonus for you (I said there were 4 stories you can tell),
there’s actually a fifth way to make people even more “thirsty” using
stories created from what’s called “future pacing.” These types of stories
explain what life will be like when they take specific actions. You explain
how your product, service, software—whatever—will help them achieve
those results. You paint the picture by telling the story of their life when
they do this.

Here’s an example:


_**“I want you to imagine having your own unique book with your name on**_
_**it as the author. You hold that book up. You show it to people. They leaf**_
_**through the pages. They see your name on the front as the author. It has**_
_**the same quality cover design as any New York Times bestseller. Now,**_
_**imagine handing that book to someone you’re trying to get to hire you to**_
_**provide a service. During a job interview, you include a copy of your book**_
_**with your resume. You are at a trade show handing out autographed**_
_**copies of your book while everybody else hands out business cards. Think**_
_**about what your life would be like when you have your own book to give**_
_**out to people. How will this boost your credibility? What will your business**_
_**look like? How will you feel about yourself? Obviously, having your own**_
_**book is something that’s important and valuable to you and your**_
_**business.”**_


What have I done there? I told a story which could be used as a
Facebook post, a blog post, or even a live video. There are pictures,
emotions, and all kinds of things in this story. But I haven’t actually taught
you how to write a book. I haven’t done anything other than just make you
“thirsty” to create your own book, if you haven’t already, or create your
next book.

Think about teaching versus selling. Teaching is stories and content.
Selling is sales copy. You can use one to set up the other, and you can use
them together. You can use stories in your sales letter to make people
“thirsty”. You can use them in your blog posts, in your videos, in your
webinars. However, you need to understand the stories and content are
what make people “thirsty”. The selling is what shows them where to buy
a drink.

### **Let’s discuss the four ways you can sell when you’re creating** **content (free or paid).**


**The first way is to give something valuable for free that naturally**
**leads to an additional purchase.** I heard a sales story years ago about a
guy who runs a newspaper ad that says, “Free boat to good home.” I doubt
it is a true story, but maybe it is. Instantly, somebody shows up at 8:00 on
Saturday morning. The guy shows him the boat and confirms, “Yep, it’s
free. You just have to haul it off.” The buyer says, “Okay, I’ll take it.”
Then the seller says, “One more thing. I’ve got a trailer over here the boat
will fit on if you’d like to have it. I’ll sell you the trailer, and I’ve also got
this outboard motor over here that I’ll sell you if you’d like to have an
outboard motor for the boat.” Whoa, think about that for a second. They’re
still getting a free boat, but to use it, they need a trailer to transport it and a
motor to drive it.

You can give something for free. Your client will love it, but you do it
in such a way that sets up the need for what you’re selling. Let me give
you another example. John Childers, a top-notch sales trainer, tells
everybody he is a speaking coach. What he teaches is the most expensive
speaker training in the world. When I went through it, it was $25,000. John


139


sells his course in this way. You paid him $5,000 up front, attended his
training, and then you agreed to give him 50% of your earned speaking
fees until you have paid him another twenty thousand dollars. That was the
deal.

John was an excellent trainer. This principle came home to me when
John trained because his whole speaker training was about how to make
money from your speaking gigs. He taught an excellent free training on
how to create a high-dollar product you would sell from the back of the
room at your speaking gigs. He showed you how to organize your own
program. He explained in explicit detail the type of microphone you
needed, how to set it up, how to use it. He described the software required
to record your product. He showed you how much money you could make
selling your own product from the back of the room. He was very specific
about how to create the product you were going to sell from the stage to
make all your money.

He gave real content. However, to sell the product you’re going to
create with everything he taught, you needed his speaker training to learn
how to give a speech that would sell your product. He made you “thirsty”
by teaching you something great that required you to buy the next step so
you could put it into action.

What if you want to be a horse rider or a cowboy? Great! Let me give
you free riding lessons and a free saddle and bridle. Now, let me sell you a
horse.

Basically, you teach somebody something or provide something that
automatically creates the need for what you’re selling. But what you’re
giving away is so valuable and good that people don’t think, “Oh, this was
just a come on for them to sell me something.” Instead, they think, “Damn,
that’s good. I want to do that. The next logical thing is to buy what they’re
selling so I can use what I just got here.”

**The second way is to tell them what to do, why they should do it,**
**and then sell them how/what they need to do it.** An example is how to
write a book. I created a webinar training that details the steps to write a
book:


_Step one: Define your target audience._
_Step two: Understand you can “create” your book’s contents faster_
_than writing it._
_Step three: You’re going to create that content via a phone interview._
_Step four: You’re going to create the cover using a designer on Fiverr._
_Here’s the link._


140


_Step five: You have your phone interview transcribed._
_Step six: You do a light edit._
_Step seven: You contract somebody on Fiverr to format your book._
_Step eight: You publish it on CreateSpace (print) and Amazon Kindle_
_(ebook)._


Those are the exact steps you need to write a book.
Now, this is why you want to write a book, and all the ways it can help

you.


It gives you credibility. It gives you authority.


You can use it as a business card when you’re meeting people at trade
shows.


You can use it as a self-liquidating offer.


You can use it as the front end of a funnel.


You can use it to get more consulting clients, to get more speaking
clients, to get more of anything.


Now that you know the steps, either you can do it manually, or you can
save time by using the software that does all the steps for you. It’s called
_The 3-Hour Kindle Book Wizard_ .

What did I do? I told you all the steps necessary to write a book
SUPER fast. I can teach those steps for about 45-minutes on a webinar,
which I have done dozens of times. At the end of the training, you will
want to buy the software that does the whole process step-by-step for you.

**The third way is to teach all the steps leading up to what you want**
**them to purchase.** For example, teach them how to set up a sales funnel
for books, software, services, or coaching. Your content would include all
the exact tools, pages, structure, and two weeks free use of your program.
The only thing the customer has to do is write the copy for those pages.
Then you tell them about a tool you have called _Funnel Scripts_ which
provides templates they can adapt for their sales copy, no matter what they
are selling.

Or, suppose you sell a weight loss supplement that tastes like cake. You
can show people different yummy recipes for how to use that weight loss
supplement to create amazing, low-calorie snacks, smoothies, cookies, and
other goodies. You could even do the demonstrations using video on social
media targeting people in your niche audience. They see you make the
recipes, they literally get hungry or thirsty watching you make the goodies,


141


and they go buy your supplement.

**The fourth way to make them “thirsty” with content is to teach**
**them the manual or hard way to do something.** Then sell them the tools,
or the easy button, to do it for them. This one works so well it is almost
like cheating. It is like showing somebody how to dig a well with a shovel
and a ladder. You teach every single step necessary to hit the water table.
At the end, you say, “Congratulations! You are fully capable of digging a
well. If you don’t mind, I’d like to take five minutes to tell you about this
thing we have called a backhoe. It can scoop out three cubic yards of dirt
at a time. Instead of digging this well over the course of a week or two by
hand, and risk serious injury or death with the thing collapsing in on you, I
can show you how you can dig it in about two hours using this cool tool.
Would you like to see it?”

Another example would be how to build a website using HTML or
CSS. You would teach how to hand code the entire website. You’d give
great detail about how to do header tags, paragraph tags, line breaks,
underline, bold, and italics using a free HTML editor. Then you would ask
them if they would like to let _ClickFunnels_ do it all for them? “And, by the
way, you can automatically integrate with an autoresponder, a payment
processor, up-sells, and everything else you need to do. Also, in the time it
takes you to code one page by hand in a text editor, you can create your
entire funnel, and be running traffic to it to see if it makes sales or not.”

The bottom line with these methods is you can give away a ton of
content if you structure it correctly, and make people even more thirsty for
what you’re selling.


Summary:

There’s no difference between the stories you use in content
marketing and in your actual sales letters and sales videos.


If you structure it right, you can give away a TON of content without
giving away anything that would prevent people from buying from

you.


Remember: Stories make people “thirsty” and sales copy tells them
where to go and how to buy a drink.

# **Secret #21** **Love Me; Hate Me. There’s No Money In The** **Middle**

_“Every product has a unique personality and it is your job to find it.”_

_Joe Sugarman_


This secret is a fun one because this is where you purposefully create your
persona or personality. People buy from a character or a persona more
easily than they buy from some unknown company. That’s why nameless
companies or companies with big names often have spokespeople. Why?
Because you can’t really have a relationship with a company, or with a
logo, but you can have a perceived relationship, or at least feel a certain
way about a person. Everything from Ronald McDonald to Tom Bodett
—“We’ll leave the light on for you at Motel 6”—to the little lady with
Wendy’s who said, “Where’s the beef?” People buy more easily from a
personality or a persona.

The fastest way to establish that persona is to take a stand, to have a
position or an opinion, and you need to be secure about it. That’s really
where the saying “Love me; hate me. There’s no money in the middle.”
came from. Who knows who said it first? But the people in the middle
don’t make any money. They are so busy trying to appease everybody that
they never do anything noteworthy for any particular group. If you look at
politics in the United States, we have a two-party system and have for a


143


couple of hundred years. The names of those parties have changed a few
times, and the positioning of those parties has flip-flopped a couple of
times, but it’s an us versus them mentality. That’s how people think.


It’s not right or wrong; it’s just the way it is. You’re either with them or
with us. The objective here is to pull people close to you (love me). If you
force people to decide about you, some will hate you for whatever reason.
They hate the tone of your voice, the cut of your suit, the fact that you’re
too fat, too fit, too tall, too short. They don’t like your mustache. Whatever
the reason, the people who hate you will still pay attention and buy from
you. That’s the weirdest thing of all.

I have people who hate my guts who buy from me consistently. They
don’t know me personally, but they hate me and still buy from me. They
love to hate me. They buy my stuff to tear it apart to feel better that they
don’t like me. Just like the people who buy my stuff who love me. They
buy my stuff, pay for my services, pay to go on cruises with me, and
belong to my monthly coaching because they love me and want to feel
close to me.

You can do the same thing. But, to get results, you must force people to
decide about you. You do this in your content and sales copy. You do it by
taking a position and being consistent with your message, your methods,
your opinions, who you like, and who you don’t. Even though you don’t
talk smack about people by name, you can talk about behavior. You can
discuss practices. You can talk about methods.

You need to have a position. “This is right; this is wrong. This is good;


144


this is bad. This works; this doesn’t work.” People are looking for a leader,
for someone to blaze the trail for them. They want someone to tell them,
“This will burn your hand, little Johnny. Don’t put your freaking hand on
the stove.” Or, “Hey Sally, this little bunny rabbit is soft and fluffy and
will make you feel wonderful if you pet it.” They’re looking for someone
to tell them their version of the truth, to give them the right story, to guide
them, and to be consistent about it. That’s why customers get so irritated
with people that have the newest, greatest thing of the week and why those
types of marketers, or sellers, or promoters have to spend more time trying
to replenish their list than they should because they’re always coming out
with the next greatest thing. _You need to be consistent._

However, don’t be afraid to change direction. If the world changes, if
circumstances change, if something makes you re-evaluate your opinion,
then you need to tell people, “Hey, I’ve changed my opinion about this.
I’ve changed my practice.” But don’t be wishy-washy. Don’t be like the
wave on the ocean getting tossed around. You need to stand firm.

Look at this quick example: For many years we did article marketing
which was our primary way to drive traffic to our website. Every week I
created an article and promoted it using a service called _Submit Your_
_Article_ . It posted your article in different announcement sites on the web,
which drove thousands of visitors a week to my websites. At the time, it
was the only thing I taught to get traffic.

One day, it stopped working. Google changed its algorithms. They
stopped counting all those articles because people did spammy articles of
little or no value. All that traffic through Google dried up, literally
overnight. Instead of trying to milk it and tell people, “Well, it may come
back,” I said, “You know what? This process isn’t working anymore, so
we need to figure out something else.”

You can’t be afraid to change direction.
I heard this saying, “Love me; hate me. There’s no money in the
middle,” from Matt Furey at a mastermind meeting in Tampa Florida in
February of 2003. When Matt spoke to the group, he looked at me and
said, “I just bought your book, and you’re selling it way too cheap.” My
eyes got wide because this is a pretty impressive guy.

I thought, “This guy forces you to form an opinion about him.”
Then he said, “The other thing that’s made a big difference in my
business is operating with the philosophy, “Love me; hate me. There’s no
money in the middle.”

It floored me. I’ll never forget hearing that for the first time. It’s made a
dramatic impact on my business because this philosophy gave me the


145


courage to stand up to people who were saying things that weren’t true.
This philosophy gave me the courage to change direction. It gave me the
courage to share my opinion. Because of this philosophy, I know that if I
try to please everybody all the time, nothing good will come from it.

When it comes to your copy and content, always remember, “Love me;
hate me. There’s no money in the middle.” Have a strong opinion. Stick
with your opinion. Don’t be afraid to change if the world proves you need
to change. Be a consistent character for the people who pay attention to

you.


Summary:

Love me; hate me. There’s no money in the middle.


Stand for something!


Be consistent in your message, opinion, and what you stand for.


Don’t be afraid to change direction and explain why to people if the
situation warrants it.


146


# **Secret #22** **“Oh Damn—I Got To Have That!”**

_“It has long been my belief that a lot of money can be made by making offers to_

_people who are at an emotional turning point in their lives.”_

_Gary Halbert_


The number one key to selling like crazy is the promise any profitable
product makes. Whatever sales copy you’re assembling, 99 percent of the
time your headline is your number one most important component. The
promise of any product or service, often contained in that headline, is the
number one key to selling like crazy.

As with any sales copy, there’s a formula for creating a profitable
promise. In this case it’s a four-part formula. They are 1) the hurdle, 2) the
prize, 3) the timing, and 4) the eliminator. Let’s take a look at each of
them.

### **Part One: The Hurdle**


First, you must address people’s concerns or questions about what they
have to do to get what they want. When someone looks at your product,
while you tell them, “Hey, this will help you get the result you want,” they
think, “Okay, but what do I have to do to _get_ that result?” Your job is to


147


understand the thing they want but see as a hard thing to do, which is the
hurdle. The result is the thing they see on the other side. It’s where they
get what they want. To understand their obstacle, pay close attention to the
action words they use. 99% of the time, the hurdle is some action that
needs to get taken.

Whatever action keywords your target audience uses are significant.
You need to pay attention to the differences, like “how to drive a golf ball”
versus “how to hit a golf ball” versus “how to strike a golf ball”. Or “how
to meet beautiful women” versus “how to date beautiful women” versus
“how to find beautiful women”. Do you see the hurdle, the action? The
ability to take the action to get the result is what they see holding them
back. This action creates a mental image. People visualize actions best
because they involve motion, and 80 percent of your brain focuses on
handling what you see. Secondly, you process motion most with your
optical hardware whether you imagine it internally or see it externally.
That’s why, when you see movement out of the corner of your eye, you
turn your head. You’re wired up to do that.

Therefore, we want to give people mental images to literally and
figuratively turn their head inside their mind. So: “How to do or
accomplish something.” It’s something they want done for them. So how
to **get**, how to **have**, how to **claim**, how to **write**, how to **publish**, how to
**create**, how to **use**, or how to **access** . What do they want to do? What is
the action or the verb they desire? “How to lose 20 pounds. How to paint
your house. How to train your dog. How to teach your kid to lift the toilet
seat.” The actions are the hurdles.

### **Part Two: The Prize**


The prize is what the person wants. It is also known as the result you
want from the taking action in the previous step. For example:


You want your own outrageously profitable e-book and fat royalty
checks


You want a passionate relationship


You want freedom from back pain


You want to golf like a seasoned pro


Again, pay close attention to the result keywords your niche uses. Some
examples:


148


How to drive a golf ball like Tiger Woods


How to hit a golf ball like Arnold Palmer


How to strike a golf ball like a veteran PGA pro


For some audiences, they know who Arnold Palmer is but they’re more
familiar with Tiger Woods or Sam Snead. You need to understand the
words they use for the prize when you start crafting and using the formula
to create your profitable product promises.

### **Part Three: The Timing**


Answer the question _When will I get what I want?_ Basically, many of
us are highly-functioning five-year-olds, wondering when Santa Claus will
show up and give us what we want. So even though you’re an adult, your
inner youth is screaming, “Well, when will I get it? When will it show up?
How long do I have to wait? I want it now!”


The timing part of the formula is where you give a timeframe they can
wrap their head around that answers their question _When will I get it?_ Will
it be an hour, an afternoon, a day, a weekend, or a week? How long will it


149


take? There are two ways to present timing. First, you reference the time it
takes for them to get the prize by taking action themselves. The key is that
it should be almost unbelievable, but within the realm of possibility so
they can only blame themselves if they don’t do it.

Examples:


Timing: Write a 100-page book in about a week.

To write a hundred page e-book in seven days is very possible. It
can be done in two to three days if you sit down and do it. But if
you don’t do it, then you know you didn’t do the work.


Timing: Create a real Kindle book in 90 minutes.

To create a nice little Kindle book in 90-minutes is very possible
with technology and strategy, if you know what you’re doing.


The second way to present time is saying how long it takes you to teach
them how to get the prize. For example:


A. How to improve your golf swing in two 30-minute sessions


B. How to improve your English in one hour


C. Give me 17-minutes, and I’ll show you how to start a conversation

with the most beautiful woman in the room


The timing can be either how long it takes for them to do it, or how
long it takes you to teach them.

### **Part Four: The Eliminator**


The eliminator lets them off the hook, as in “it’s not their fault” they
don’t have what they want yet. Everyone puts up mental barriers about
what’s stopping them, such as stumbling blocks, or obstacles, or painful
actions, or they don’t know the next step, or other perceived barriers
holding them back. Whether they’re real or imagined, these are real
barriers to them. It’s going to take too long, cost too much, be too hard, or
they don’t know what to do. If you don’t eliminate the excuse that holds
them back, then you’re screwed.

The excuses result from past effort, pain, or failure. It may well be their
fault for not getting the results they want, but you can’t tell them it’s their

**never**
fault because they’ll get all pissy and defensive. Remember that you
say it’s their fault. Let me repeat that. **Under no circumstances do you**


150


**tell them it is their fault for not getting the results they want** . Yeah, I
know the reason many people can’t lose weight is because they don’t have
enough sense to push back from the table before they eat that third
cheeseburger. But I won’t tell them that. I will tell them, “It’s not your
fault because you’ve been lied to about how carbs and proteins and
vegetables interact. And if you will just change your strategy for how you
eat, you will start losing weight.” When it comes to sales copy, it’s not
their fault. Ever. Burn that into your brain.

This last part of the formula forces you to make a better offer. You
have to remove what’s holding the person back in order to get the sale.
And when you remove what’s holding them back, your offer will be
incredible because this formula forces you to think creatively.

Let’s look at a quick example that starts to pull it all together: “How to
write and publish your own outrageously profitable e-book in as little as
seven days.” That has three of the parts, but no eliminator. The reader
says, “Oh, that’s awesome. But I’m not a writer, so this won’t work for
me.”

So we add this little bit at the end: “. . . even if you can’t write, can’t
type, and failed high school English class.” That’s your eliminator. Notice
the use of the transition “even if,” or “even if you can’t” to let them off the
hook. Or you can add the phrase “without _____” and you have, “How to
write and publish your own outrageously profitable eBook in as little as
seven days without typing a single word of it yourself.”

So, whatever the pain, whatever the effort, whatever tough actions
they’d expect, you want to sweep those out from under them, so they say,
“Oh, dang. You mean I don’t have to sit there and type it? You mean I
don’t have to sit there and write it? You mean I don’t have slave away at
the keyboard? Okay, you got my attention!”

There are some promise superchargers you can add to make this
formula even more powerful. The first is the money promise, but be
careful with this one. “Make as much as an extra hundred dollars a day.”
“How to make a thousand dollars as a _____ or with _____or doing
_____.” And you can forgive past mistakes. “Even if you’ve tried before
and failed.” “How to write and publish your own outrageously profitable
e-book in as little as seven days, even if you’ve tried to publish a book
before and failed miserably.” Or “Even if you hate writing and can only
type with two fingers.”

The second is with a timeline or with timing. “In 60 minutes or less;”
“In seven days or less;” “in less than a week;” or “in less than an hour.”

The third is a cost modifier. “For less than $50;” “For less than the cost


151


of a cup of coffee at Starbucks;” “For less than a medium everything pizza
every month.” Use this supercharger in such a way that they think, “Oh
damn. So, for less than it costs to get a medium pizza every month, I can
have this? Heck, yeah.”

Now, in what niche groups of people does this formula work? It works
with everyone who needs a problem solved or has an intense desire. You
don’t have to use these elements in order, but you want to try to put them
in your titles, headlines, and promises. The biggest thing you need to know
is what they want or what’s their number one problem.

Let’s look at some examples.


1. Dating: “How to use online dating sites like match.com to find the

love of your life in 30 days without wasting time on the wrong
people.” “How to use online dating sites like match.com to find the
love of your life within 30 days and it costs less than an everything
pizza to join.” “How to use online dating sites like match.com to find
the love of your life within 30 days, even if you’ve failed at online
dating before.”


2. Real estate: “How you can use eBay Real Estate to cash in with your

first money-making deal within 72-hours, no matter where you live in
the world. All you need is internet access and a desire to make
money.” “How you can use eBay Real Estate to cash in on your first
money-making deal within 72-hours, even if you’ve never bought a
house before in your life.” “How you can use eBay Real Estate to
cash in on your first money-making deal within 72-hours, even if you
have no money of your own to invest.”


3. Marital advice: “How to get your spouse or lover talking again and

save your relationship with one 15-minute session, even if everything
you’ve tried in the past didn’t work.” “How to get your spouse or
lover talking again and save your relationship in one 15-minute
session, even if you’ve experienced a failed marriage in the past.”


4. Dog training: “Seven cool tricks every dog can learn in a weekend.

Fun, fast, and stress-free.”


The bottom line is, when you use all four parts of the Profitable Product
Promise formula—the hurdle, the prize, the timing, and the eliminator—to
hit the hot buttons and check all the boxes that your prospects need to buy,
you create irresistible offers that address all the things that are holding
them back.


152


Summary:

The promise you make in your sales copy directly affects how many
people buy from you.


When you make an amazing promise (and fulfill it) your sales can go
through the roof.


Include each part of the formula because each hits a critical point in
your prospects decision making process.


Never, EVER make them feel like it’s their fault they don’t have what
they want yet.

# **Secret #23** **Put Lipstick On The Pig**

_“Nobody reads ads. People read what interests them. Sometimes it’s an ad.”_

_Howard Gossage_


How do you make bad or underperforming copy pop? Sometimes you
can’t, and it’s easier to start over. Sometimes you’ll work on something,
pour your blood, sweat, and tears into it, and it just plain sucks. Sometimes
it’s best to walk away from it.

However, sometimes you can put lipstick on a pig and turn it into a
beauty queen.

Here’s what to do if your copy isn’t working: ask yourself a series of
questions. You want to see whether or not you’ve missed something that is
causing one or more areas of your copy to underperform.

### **Look at the headline.**


Do you have a headline? You’d be surprised how many people don’t
have a headline. Why in the world would anybody not have a
headline? It is the first thing somebody sees on your page. It can also


154


be the first words that come out of your mouth in a video sales letter.
You’d be surprised how many people don’t have anything even
remotely resembling a headline.


Is your headline about you or your audience? Once I had a headline
about how I went from trailer trash to piles of cash. I thought it was
an amazing headline. It fell flat on its face! But when I changed it to
how to gain a positively unfair advantage in business and life, then
my sales took off by over 500 percent.


Is there a big, bold benefit or promise? You can always create a
headline that causes people to stop what they’re doing. A great
example is saying something like, “Sex!” Or, “Emergency!” The
problem is that it makes the wrong people stop. So they stop and read
it, and then they get pissed off because it has nothing to do with them
(or sex). So is there a bold benefit or promise in your headline that’s
going to attract the right people to stop and pay attention?

### **Is the offer clear?**


Does the buyer understand what they will get? Is it crystal clear?
“You’re going to get this, this, this, this, this and this.”


How do they get it? Is it delivered digitally? Does it come overnight?
Is it a physical product? Is it an electronic product? Is it coaching?
What is it?


When do they get it? Do they get it instantly? Do they get it
tomorrow? Do they get it next week? Do they get it once a month for
the next 12 months? Is it on-demand?


How much does it cost? If they can’t tell how much it is fairly easily
by reading your message, you turn people off, because they feel like
you’re hiding something.

### **Is there a clear reason to buy now?**


Is there a clear reason for them to buy right now? You can have the
greatest offer in the world, but if there’s no urgency to buy now, then they
won’t. Traditionally, these are the three ways to get people to buy now:


Bonuses. Stack on added value to your fantastic offer if they buy right

now.


155


Time deadline. People often use this with large product launches.
They set the deadline and shut down the offer on that Friday. The
problem comes in when, next Tuesday, they tell you their buddy
emailed them, “Hey, please can you open this up just for my people
for 24 hours?” The person thought, “Well, that’s not fair. So I have to
open it up for everybody for 24 hours. So in case you missed it, or in
case you waited, you have 24 hours again.” If you do that, you just
blew your integrity.


Limited quantities. This is a double-edged sword. You have a high
performing offer, but when you run out of limited quantities, that’s
when people see if you have any integrity. If you magically add more
quantities, and the offer keeps going, the people who bought realize
you lied.


When I launched my first big product about how to create your own
multimedia info products, I learned a valuable lesson about time deadlines.
In 2003, I was one of the first people in the world to show people how to
create content and burn it to CD or deliver it over the web. It was cutting
edge, with screen capture video and full motion video. I made enough
money from that promotion to pay off my house.

When the time deadline came that I promised to stop selling the
product, I was bummed out. My wife asked, “What’s wrong?” I said, “I’ve
got a perfect offer and a great product. And I can never sell it again.” To
keep my integrity, I had to respect the time deadline and never sell the
product again.

I learned my lesson. When I came out with my next big product, I did
not use time deadlines or limited quantities. Instead, I used the fear of
losing out, which is a much better reason for them to buy now. That
product ended up making around five million dollars because I wasn’t
stupid enough to depend on the time deadline. It takes a little more skill to
come up with, but if you can incorporate the fear of losing out into your
copy, then you do much better.

How do you use this technique? You use what’s called _future pacing_ .
“Hey, if you don’t buy this, here’s what’s going to happen: You won’t be
able to do this or have that. You won’t have the ability to (whatever).” And
if you lay on three, four, or five reasons why waiting will result in their
lunch eaten by a competitor or be stuck where they are, you don’t have to
depend on things like time deadlines and limited quantities. You can do a
lot better for a lot longer.

### **Is there an emotional driver in the copy?**

Do you have an emotion to grab people right at the beginning of your
copy? It can be fear, desire, curiosity, pain, pleasure, satisfaction, or
dissatisfaction (when you talk about problems).

There has to be emotion infused into your copy. You create it by
circumstances they either want to get rid of or want to create. Your copy
either drives them towards something they want or helps them to move
away from something they don’t like. They’re moving toward something
they want or running away from something they hate. But there has to be
an emotional component in the copy.

So, if your copy’s not performing, you need to look at it and say, “Is
there something here that grabs people emotionally other than the promise
to make money?” And nine times out of ten, from my experience, people
buy out of dissatisfaction with their current circumstances.


157


People may be driven, or at least somewhat motivated by, what they
want, but what gets people to act is dissatisfaction. Because, if things are
good enough, people will sit on the crappy couch, eating Cheetos,
watching a TV that is sort of tuned in, because, until it hurts enough to
make a change, people don’t change.

So remember that. Nine times out of ten, people buy out of
dissatisfaction with current circumstances. It creates the drive to buy now,
rather than put it off.

### **Do your bullets suck?**


Are your bullets curiosity drivers, or are they boring, bland, and read
like a technical manual? We’ve done an entire secret on bullets and the
proper bullet formula (see Secret #9). So the question is, are you featuring
features, or are you highlighting benefits and payoffs? Bullets are what
build the desire and curiosity that drive people to take action, enter their
credit card information (especially online), and buy from you.

### **What about the price?**


Is the price too high relative to what others are charging? Now, that
doesn’t mean you can’t charge a premium price as long as your offer
justifies charging a premium price. On the flip side, is your price too low,
creating the perception that you’re too cheap?

Think about it. For example, if you had a course on how to do options
trading focused on a biz-op, work-at-home market for $97, you might do
very well. You have a very different price than if you focus on a group of
experienced investors looking to branch out into an options or futures
market. If they saw your product was $97, they would laugh and think it
wasn’t even worth their time. They’d think it was way too cheap and
wasn’t worth anything. So your price can be too high, but it can also be too
low. How do you find out? Test.

When you look at your price, ask if the value is there. Does it feel like a
great deal? Does it feel like, “Wow! This offer is amazing. I need to buy
this before they raise the price or change their minds.”

There’s a concept called selling dollars for dimes that I learned from a
man named Marlon Sanders. In the prospect’s mind, your offer combined
with your bonuses must be worth ten times what you charge. That seems to
be the magic number.


158


Now, whether it needs to be ten-to-one or twenty-to-one or five-to-one
or thirteen-to-one isn’t the issue. Your offer must feel like you’re selling
dollars for dimes. Think of it this way: If somebody offered, “I will sell
you as many dollars as you want for just 10 cents apiece. How many do
you want?” Your answer is, “As many as I can get.” That’s the feeling you
want people to have.

If your sales price is $97, you want to give a thousand dollars in
demonstrable value. That’s selling dollars for dimes. If you’re charging a
thousand dollars, then you want somebody to feel they’re getting ten
thousand dollars’ worth of value.

Now, like I said, it’s not always ten-to-one. But it has to feel like this is
a fantastic, authentic, real deal. So if your copy’s not performing, it may be
the price, or the perceived value, that’s not where it needs to be.

### **Are you using the right graphics and colors?**


Do your graphics add to the message? Do you have any graphics? If
you do, do they raise the emotion, distract people, or make people feel bad
when they look at your copy even if they don’t know why?

Be careful with your colors. Do your colors match, or does it look like a
psychedelic acid trip? Is the website so ugly it makes you want to smack
its mama? You are better off with a site that’s plain and conservative than
you are with one that’s crazy and assaults people’s eyeballs.

You do want to use graphics appropriately. Each major point or idea in
your sales copy should have an accompanying graphic.

### **What about proof?**


It could be that people don’t believe you. Do you offer proof, especially
around your claims? Any time you make a claim, you need to have
something to back it up. It could be a testimonial, a case study, some
statistics, or an expert endorsement. Whenever people could think, “Mm,
I’m not sure about that,” or “I doubt that,” or some smart aleck in the back
of a room screams, “Prove it!” that’s when you need to have some sort of
third-party validation that what you’re doing works and is accurate.

Your proof could be screenshots, before and after pictures with weight
loss, or photographs of bank statements, checks, and closing statements.
But you need to be careful that you can genuinely substantiate these kinds
of authentication. The FTC loves to come after these claims.


159


As a side note, if you’re in investing, weight loss, or anything that
involves people’s health or their money, you need to be doubly cautious
about any claims you make and use the right disclaimers. Any pictures or
testimonials you use must be 100 percent rock solid. You don’t want to run
into a situation where you can’t substantiate it because you haven’t kept
good records.

These are several of the ways to put lipstick on a pig. While they aren’t
all the ways, they’re a darn good start.


Summary:

If your copy is not performing, try putting some lipstick on it. That
means going through this list to ensure you haven’t missed anything.


#1 thing to test is your headline (assuming you have one) to see how
that affects conversion.


Make sure your offer is very clear and they know what they’re
getting.


Try selling dollars to dimes to see if you can improve the
performance of your copy.


160


# **Secret #24** **Should I Join The Dark Side?**

_“Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears_

_and desires that already exists in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those_

_already existing desires onto a particular product. This is the copy writer’s task:_

_not to create this mass desire—but to channel and direct it.”_


_Eugene Schwartz_


There are two ways you can go negative with your copywriting. There’s
one good way and one bad way.

The good way to go negative is to meet people in their internal
conversation. You talk about their problems, their mistakes, their fears,
and their enemies (real or perceived). You warn against adverse events and
advice. Use the negative going on inside of their head to get in sync with
them. Because until you get in sync with them, they won’t pay attention to

you.

Let’s look at a couple of examples. What problems would dog trainers
have? Perhaps getting more clients. A negative could be, “Are you having
trouble attracting good clients for your dog training business?” “Are you
dealing with problem customers?” You lead with a negative like this.

How about real estate investors? What negative could you lead with?
“Having trouble finding good deals?” “Having trouble with no money for
down payment?” “Do you have bad credit?” “Is bad credit holding you
back from finding or financing your deals?” “Can you find deals, but you
can’t find any way to fund them?” These are all negatives you can use to


161


enter the conversation going on in somebody’s mind.

How about doctors? “Has malpractice insurance crushed your
profitability?” Whoa, now that’s something to think about. Maybe a doctor
has staffing problems. Maybe a doctor has issues with patient satisfaction.
“Have a problem with health insurance not paying out on time or cutting
your fees?”

How about funnel hackers? “Can’t get enough traffic?” “Ads not
converting?” “Trouble getting all the mechanics set up for your funnels?”

Use the negative to get in sync with somebody. Once you get in sync
with them, then you transition to your solution. Nobody cares about your
answer until they know you care about their problem. There’s an adage
that says, “Nobody cares how much you know until they know how much
you care.” You may think that’s an old, tired, worn out phrase, but it is as
valid now as it has ever been. Especially with online sales copy.

So once they know you’re paying attention to them because you
acknowledged their problem, then you demonstrate the solution to the
problem. You explain how your product prevents mistakes. You put their
fears to rest with proof. You show how to defeat their enemies. Whether
they’re real or perceived, those enemies are real to them, and that’s all that
matters. Then you give them a roadmap or inoculate them against future
adverse events.

Those are all excellent negatives to include in your copywriting,
content, and communication. They are like public service announcements.
You can think about it this way, “I’m helping you avoid problems. I’m
helping you overcome roadblocks. I’m answering the questions that are
holding you back.” You are performing a public service for your target
audience, whether it’s through your copywriting, videos, or content.

So that’s the good way to go negative. Use the bad to get in sync with
where your potential customer is right now.


Let’s look at the negative negatives. And by the way, a negative
negative does not make a positive. The best example of what not to do is


162


any political attack ad you’ve ever seen. These ads that call names and
throw dirt create a toxic environment for everyone. You might think, “I
would never do that in my business.” That’s wonderful. But I have seen
people do this, and it is detrimental.


Bottom line: you never outright attack somebody. You can attack
behavior. If you see something that somebody’s doing, say, “You know
what? I’ve seen people doing this, and I don’t think it’s right. Here is why
and what people should do instead.” You can attack results if they don’t
make sense or could ultimately hurt them. For example, a chiropractor sees
somebody teach a patient to do a particular exercise that would injure
somebody. Then you should bring that to people’s attention.

You can also attack a method. “Why would you keep doing things the
way they did them in the last century when we’ve had advances in
technology and strategy that make it a hundred times easier to get results?
So stop doing things the old way; start doing things the new way.”

You can attack behavior. You can attack results. You can attack a
method. But you never attack a person or a company by name. You never,
ever call somebody out. It never pays off. It only creates problems. And it
will come back and bite you ninety-nine times out of a hundred.

Now, here’s what we don’t mean by not going negative. That sounds
like a triple negative. We don’t mean that everything is super positive.
There’s a Disney character named Pollyanna who was positive about
everything. She would, no matter what anyone said, find the positive spin
on it. She was so sickly sweet, I wanted to reach through the screen and
choke her. This girl fell out of a third-story window, broke her back, and
was still positive about everything as they carried her away at the end of


163


the movie. So we don’t want to fall into that trap of “everything’s always
positive.” That won’t resonate with people.

What if you are in a situation where you must compare and contrast
yourself with someone else? Especially if somebody is doing something
that is not in people’s best interest? You want to say something like this,
“Now some of our competitors will tell you _____, but that’s just not true.
Here are the facts you need to know.” You don’t mention anybody by
name. For instance, “Some of our competitors will tell you it’s okay to use
a choke chain when training a large dog, but that’s not true. Here are the
facts you need to know.” “Some of our competitors will tell you to use a
third-party email service provider to send your email, but that’s not a good
idea. Here are the facts that you need to know.” “Some of our competitors
will tell you they have great deliverability rates just like us, but that’s not
true. Here are the facts you need to see.”

This is a way you can sweep the legs out from under them. Without
mentioning anyone by name or calling them out, you say, “You know, this
is not true.” Or you can say something like, “You may have noticed some
people are _____, but we don’t think that’s right. Here’s why.” “You may
have noticed some people charge extra for _____, but we don’t think that’s
right. Here’s why.” “You may have noticed some people make you pay for
a separate third-party email relay service, but we don’t think that’s right.
Here’s why.” You’re getting the message out there, but you’re sweeping it
out of the way and saying what you think is essential for them to make a
good decision (which is to buy from you).

Whatever your target audience has experienced, you can key in on a
negative without being confrontational or combative or attacking someone
by name.

Remember, you can go negative without joining the dark side by using
the negative to get in sync with people. You can always attack the
behavior, the idea, or practice, but never, ever name names.


Summary:

There’s a good way and a bad way to “go negative.”


Use negatives to get in sync with people and the conversations going
on in their heads.


Never go negative by attacking someone or a company by name. It
never pays off and very often backfires.

# **Secret #25** **“Stealth” Closes—The Secret To Selling** **Without Selling**

_“Tap a single overwhelming desire existing in the hearts of thousands of people_

_who are actively seeking to satisfy it at this very moment.”_

_Eugene Schwartz_


Wouldn’t it be amazing to turn any piece of content, any video, any article,
any blurb, snippet, or even the humblest tweet into your secret sales agent
any time you want? Of course it would. Is it possible to sell without
selling? How do you put sales into content like info videos, articles, and
stuff that’s not sales-oriented? The answer is Stealth Closes (aka The
Columbo Close).

In the TV show _Columbo_, the main character was a police detective
who investigated murders or heinous crimes. Because he appeared humble
and bumbling, nobody took him seriously. The bad guys didn’t see him as
a threat but more of a nuisance. In every episode, the bad guy or gal
thought they had gotten away with the crime. In the last 30 seconds to five
minutes, Columbo would show up, ask a few questions, act like everything
was fine, and then say, “Oh, by the way, what happened with that drink or


165


empty cup I saw on the bar?” Or, “Whatever happened with that?” The
person’s guard was down, so they would answer the question which would
convict them.

The Columbo Close is a way to fly under people’s radar. Most people
looking at advertising have their defenses up. Whether consciously or
subconsciously they think, “This person is trying to sell me something. I
have to be careful because every time I see one of these ads I end up
buying something. Then my wife yells at me because I’m racking up the
credit cards. So, I have to be careful. I’m buying nothing. I’m just
looking.” They have their anti-sale radar on full blast. A Stealth Close is a
very subtle way to direct someone where you want them to go without
them realizing what you are doing.

Often, you start a Stealth Close with these three words: “By the way.”
Let me show you a real example from an email teaser I sent.

_Subject Line: Hey, [first name], the perfect picture._


_Jim Edwards here with an article below that will get published in my_
_newspaper column tomorrow, but you get the scoop today. So if you_
_make websites, mini-sites, content sites, brochures, fliers, e-book_
_covers, DVD covers, or anything else that requires images, this article_
_has some excellent information for you that will save you both time and_

_money._


_By the way, it’s still not too late to sign up for the Website Video_
_Secrets workshop in LA next week. Get all the details here at_
[websitevideosecrets.com](http://www.websitevideosecrets.com) _.”_

Now, what does the Video Secrets workshop have to do with the
newspaper column? Absolutely nothing. But I whack them out of the blue
after I’ve given them value.

The Stealth Close also works well in the P.S. of a message. Here’s
another example:

_“I’ve got an article for you about how people are fencing stolen goods_
_on eBay, and you need to be careful.” And then, “P.S. We have a few_
_seats left for our live Website Video Secrets Workshop in Atlanta on_
_April 5th and 6th. If you want to discover the secrets to making simple_
_little videos that drive traffic, make people click, and generate fat_
_commissions, get more information here right now.”_


Then I included the link. Again, it’s a pivot. Think about a judo jiu-jitsu
move. The person comes at you with one thing, you step to the side, and
they get flipped.


166


So, how does this work?
There are two parts. In part one, you give some value. In the above
example, I gave value. “Hey, here’s a cool article. Here’s a video. Here’s
(what-have-you).” Then in step two, you invite them to another level by
merely using the words “by the way.”

Where do you use a Stealth Close to get the best results? They work
exceptionally well in email teasers. Often, I will send the email with the
value just so that I can give the Stealth Close. It’s like the value I offer is
the toll I pay to deliver the Stealth Close message. This close is different
from a sponsor ad or a display ad that screams, “Hey, this is an ad. You
can ignore me.” It’s virtually impossible for them to separate the Stealth
Close from the rest of the message, which is the whole purpose of it.

As an example:
_“P.S. We have a few seats left for our live Website Video Secrets_
_Workshop in Atlanta. If you want to discover the secrets to making_
_simple little videos that drive traffic, make people click, and generate_
_fat commissions, get more information here right now.”_


You can use the Stealth Close technique verbally, in text, or anywhere.
First you deliver value and then pivot to get a signup, a subscriber,
whatever you want to get done.

You can also use this type of close in articles. At the end of a pretty
long article I published, it says, “By the way, if you’d like to sell more,
promote your books, and create incredible content using interviews, The
Expert Interview Wizard helps you make everything you need to create
and promote amazing, profitable interviews in just three to five minutes
flat. Watch the demo and get a special price, but only for a limited time,
[interviewwizardspecial.com.”](http://www.interviewwizardspecial.com)

On the surface, does that appear to be an ad? No. It just pivots from
content to the next step I want them to take. Also, (and this is key) it’s not
formatted any differently from the rest of the material. That’s important.
Nothing screams ad faster than something that stands out as different. It
screams, “Hey, I’m not content.”

You can also do this in blog posts. In a blog post all about Evergreen
Products, I taught how to create them, how to make them, and why you
want to have them. And then the pivot is, “By the way, one of the easiest
and most useful Evergreen Info Products you can create is an interview
with an expert. Either you as the expert providing information or you as
the host interviewing someone else. Interviews are not only easy to create,
but you can publish them as books, e-books, DVDs, webinars,


167


teleseminars, home study courses, and more. Interviews are like the Swiss
Army Knife of the info product creation world. One more thing, if you’d
like to sell more, promote more . . . .” It is formatted the same as the rest of
the blog post.

You can use Stealth Closes in your Kindle books. So if you’re
publishing Kindle books, regular books, or e-books, you can use Stealth
Closes any time you mention a resource. You can even do a Stealth Close
at the beginning of your book to get more subscribers, including the people
that don’t buy. At the beginning of that book, have a page that says, “By
the way, if you’d like a free audiobook version, head on over to
mysite.com/audiobook and register your copy now.”

This is a great example of how you can leverage copywriting in
something where people aren’t expecting sales copy.

This format works in Facebook posts, YouTube videos, Pinterest, or
anywhere you create and share content. This method also works well on
Facebook live videos. End every video with a “by the way” statement and
direct them to something that makes you money or gets you a subscriber.
It’s easy and effective when you get in the habit of doing it.

### **Why do you want to use Stealth Closes instead of the usual** **direct call to action?**


Because the typical call to action is something like this, “Click here
now to _____.” There’s nothing wrong with that. It works well in the right
circumstances, but people also know what’s coming. People know, “This
is where they transition from the free stuff to selling me something. This is
where they want me to sign up for something.” Don’t get me wrong. I’ve
made millions of dollars with that phrase, “Click here now to _____.” It
has its place, especially on a sales letter or on a sales page, where someone
knows they’re in a sales situation.


168


But what if they don’t know they’re in a sales situation? Or they don’t
want to be in a sales situation? Or they don’t want to go from Facebook,
where they’re getting all this free content, over to somewhere else where
you might try to sell them something? That’s when the Stealth Closes
come in because people’s defenses are up. A Stealth Close allows you to
slide in under their defenses just like a Stealth Bomber. We use Stealth
Closes to drive traffic from free content to paid offers. You don’t use a
Stealth Close on an actual sales letter or in a video sales letter.


Let’s talk about how to use Stealth Closes to drive traffic from free
content to paid offers. Step one is to teach them something, to offer value.
Hook them in with the promise (and delivery) of value. Give them tips.
My buddy, Mike Stewart, likes to call them “Didja Knows?” So, “Didja
know there are three ways to create and publish a book without writing?
Absolutely. Here they are.”

You solve problems. “Hey, are you having trouble figuring out how to
get a great-looking cover for your Kindle books? Not a problem. I will
show you right now how you can get a great-looking cover made for five
dollars.”

Answer questions. “Hey, have you ever wondered how I make sales of
my Kindle book once I post it to Amazon? Well, you know, a lot of people
have that same question. Here are five things to help you answer that
question.”

Then step two is to say, “By the way, did you know _____? Well,
_____ and _____, it’s true. Check it out.” Example: “Hey, by the way, did
you know that 3-Hour Kindle Book Wizard will help you create and
publish your book in less than three hours of total effort? It’s true. Check it
out.”

Or, “Hey, did you know there is a software you can fill out in about 10
minutes that will create everything you need to create and publish your
book on Amazon? It’s true, and you can check out a demo right here at 3

169


Hour Kindle Book Wizard.”

Whatever you teach them, use a “by the way” statement to tell them
where they can get a benefit. You tie it into an advantage they want, that
goes along with whatever you taught them. The easiest way is to tie them
to the ten reasons why people buy anything from Secret #3.


1. Make money


2. Save money


3. Save time


4. Avoid effort


5. Escape mental or physical pain


6. Get more comfort


7. Achieve greater cleanliness or hygiene to attain better health


8. Gain praise


9. Feel more loved


10. Increase their popularity or social status


Hopefully you see how these Copywriting Secrets play off one another
and help you to get better at copywriting.

Let’s make using Stealth Closes a habit because that’s where you find
the real profits. Use Stealth Closes a lot so you get the benefits ongoing.
Here’s your rule to live by. Any time you publish anything, take the words
—by the way, did you know—and tell them something.

_By the way, did you know that you can _____ with _____? Yep, it’s_
_true. Go here for more information._


_By the way, did you know _____ will help you _____? Yep, it’s true. Go_
_here for a quick demo._


_By the way, did you know we still have _____ available? Yep, it’s true._
_Go here to find out more._


_By the way, did you know _____ is on sale for _____? Yep, it’s true. Go_
_here to find out how you can grab one for 75% off._


Stealth Closes could be the most potent secret weapon in your content
marketing arsenal because hardly anybody knows about them. They don’t


170


even think about it. Everyone uses that direct frontal assault as a call to
action. The other reason you should use them is they work great. They fly
under people’s radar, and you can incorporate sales copy into everything
you do without people realizing it.

Now, if you’re thinking, “Well, if I say ‘by the way’ all the time,
people will begin to recognize that and see it coming, and it will be just
like any other ad.” Maybe. But there other things you can say like, “Oh,
before I forget;” “Oh, one more thing;” “Hey, by the way;” “Hey, did you
know?” “Hey, did you realize?” There are so many different ways to make
that segue and do the Stealth Close to get surprising results.

There are a million different ways to use Stealth Closes. Commit that
nothing you do goes out without a close, no matter how unlikely it might
be. When you do this consistently, you will see an amazing transformation
in the number of people who do what you want them to do as a result of
viewing your content.


Summary:

People’s sales radar defenses are up all the time.


Stealth Closes help you fly under their defenses and get them to take
the actions you want them to take.


Make the commitment that you will include a Stealth Close
somewhere in your free (and paid) content to drive people to your
sales copy and offers.

# **Secret #26** **The Hired Gun**

_“If you think it’s expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire_

_an amateur.”_


_Red Adair_


Here are some realities of outsourcing sales copy. I am not a huge fan of
outsourcing copy. Not because I’m a glutton for punishment and not
because I think that sitting around and creating copy is the most exciting
thing in the world I could be doing compared to other stuff.

But the reality is that nobody knows your product as well as you do.
Nobody knows your market as well as you do. So half the problem, or the
challenge, of hiring somebody to write copy for you is that you have to
teach them all they need to know about your product and your market to be
able to figure out how to write sales copy for you.

You can’t say, ”I’m going to go find somebody to write me a sales
letter in my orchid growing niche. Let me go find an orchid growing
copywriter.” It’s not that easy. To find a good copywriter, you have to find


172


somebody who understands your product and market. 999 times out of
1,000, the only way that happens is, you have to teach them.

An outside perspective can be good sometimes, especially if you are
not an experienced copywriter. If you’re too close to your product, an
outside person can help you see the forest for the trees as opposed to being
focused on one tree.


However, I’ve found that if you’re looking for an outside perspective,
it’s more helpful to hire a good, experienced copywriter to critique your
copy once you’ve created it. Ask them to do something similar to Secret
#23: Putting Lipstick on the Pig. They can run down the checklist to see
where there’s a problem.

To have somebody write copy for you, they’re going to ask you lots
and lots of questions. You will do at least one big, extended interview with
them, if not more, which is a lot of work. You have to sit down and
identify your market, what are the benefits, what are the payoffs, what is
your audience’s motivation, what is the emotional impact, what is their
reason to buy, how to get them to buy now, and what the limited time
bonus is, etc.

Then you must communicate all that information to someone else who
is unfamiliar with your market and audience. In the end, if they’ve done
their job right, you get back sales copy that spits back what you told them.


173


All they do is plug your ideas into their swipe file.

The bottom line is, you get your stuff back. Somebody else will take
your stuff, put it into their framework, give it back to you, and charge you
a thousand bucks, five thousand, ten thousand, fifteen or twenty thousand
dollars.

So that begs the question, when should you do it versus when should
you not do it? When should you hire somebody to do it for you? My
honest answer is you should be able to write your own sales copy, but you
don’t have to do it all the time. Typically, you’re not going to do it when
you don’t have time.

And that’s fair. That’s fine. If you don’t have time to do it, you’re
probably making money in your business, and it’s worth it to you to be
able to hire somebody to write the first draft. But you should be good
enough at copywriting that you can look at what they send you, know if
it’s any good, and tweak it to make it even more effective for your target
audience.

Give up the dream that you can hire a copywriter, tell them to write you
a sales letter to sell your product, and a sales letter or video sales letter
script magically appears a few days later that makes you money with no
effort on your part. That is a pipe dream. It cannot happen. You’ll do the
work one way or another (and probably waste a TON of time and money
paying for that lesson if you choose to ignore my advice).

If you choose to outsource it, here’s how to do it well.
First, audition people with a small project. Do not hire somebody for
ten or fifteen thousand bucks to write a 30-page sales letter unless you
know them, know their results, or you have a good authority referral. I
consider good authority God; everybody else is suspect. Do not make this
costly mistake. Instead, hire three or four people to do a small project.
Have them do something like write an email teaser. Have them write a set
of headlines, do an introductory paragraph, or an offer summary. See if
they can deliver something that makes sense in your market with your
specific product.

The second thing is to ask for examples of their work. Read the samples
and verify they were the ones who wrote them. Here’s a dirty little secret
about hiring copywriters: there are different levels of copywriters. When
you hire somebody on the cheap, he’s often outsourcing to a junior
copywriter. The junior guy creates your stuff, but the person you hired
charges you his fee while paying junior 30 percent of that. That happens
all the time, not only with copywriting but also content creation. These
people are all just whoring around with each other.


174


To make sure the work is theirs, get names of their past clients. Ask for
these and talk to the people. “Hey, did so and so write this for you? How
was the process? What were your results?”

Also, be careful that they aren’t taking boilerplate sales copy and
regurgitating you into the exact same thing they made for someone else in
the same niche. I’m all for using swipe files, but not find and replace! One
way to check is by using a plagiarism detector on Google. Paste in some of
the copy and see if it shows up all over the web. If you see the same sales
letter show up in five, ten, or fifteen different places with simple name
changes, you know they use a boilerplate. You would be shocked at what
people will do. Again, once they get your money, they’re done. There’s
nothing you can do. So, be careful.

Third, keep in mind the size of the project you want them to do. Vetting
somebody to write an email for you is very different than hiring somebody
to write a long-form sales letter. The price will be different, too. You hire
different people to do different things.

The biggest reason Russell Brunson and I created [FunnelScripts.com](http://www.FunnelScripts.com)
was because once you understand that sales copy is nothing more than
assembling a bunch of different parts through a process of asking and
answering questions, and plugging those parts into proven blueprints and
formulas, you never look at copy the same way again. You realize that’s
basically what most copywriters do. Not all, but most copywriters do that.
So why not do it for yourself, especially when you have a cool tool like
Funnel Scripts to help you do it?

When you get the copy back from the professional copywriter, you
need to tweak that copy. You can’t expect it to work right out of the box.
They will hand you the first draft. You or somebody else will go through,
work it over, tweak it, bend it, mold it, shape it, and test it to see if it’s
going to work. When you look at all the work you still have to do when
you hire somebody, in most cases, it’s just easier for you to do it yourself.


Summary:

Hiring someone to write sales copy for you is not a set it and forget it
affair.


You should audition people with smaller jobs first to find people who
can do work for you and weed out the ones who can’t.


Understand that you will still have to do work to get good sales copy
back from any copywriter you hire.


Understand that what you get back from a copywriter is only the first


175


draft. You’ll still need to tweak it, edit it, etc.

# **Secret #27** **The Magic Desk**

_“The very first thing you must come to realize is that you must become a ‘student_
_of markets.’ Not products. Not techniques. Not copywriting. Not how to buy space_

_or whatever. Now, of course, all of these things are important and you must learn_

_about them, but, the first and the most important thing you must learn is what_

_people want to buy.”_

_Gary Halbert_


It’s a challenge we all face. How do you get out of your head and into the
mind of your prospects?

When you’re writing copy or creating content, it’s always easier to see
how other people should be doing it, rather than it is for you to look at
what you’re doing in your businesses, or with your copy. In other words,
it’s much easier for you to spot the problems, or the successes, in other
people’s copy, or in their content than it is to detect the issues or the angles
in your own. The reason is that you’re too close to it. You can’t get out of
your head. You can’t see the forest for the trees.

Let’s walk through a cool exercise that helps you to get out of your
head and into the mind of your prospects. This activity works best after
you’ve researched your target market. You don’t just yank this out of thin
air. You have to know your target avatar Fred, that we covered in depth in
Secret #8. Do this exercise after you fully define your customer avatar.

Here’s how to do the “magic desk” exercise, which is guided
visualization: read through it once to understand what to do. This


177


technique helps you get inside the mind of your prospects so you know
what they’re thinking and more importantly, how to give them exactly
what they want in a way they want it and explain it all in terms they can
understand. As you do this, all I ask is that you have an open mind. It is
going to seem a little strange, especially if you’ve never done a
visualization exercise or practiced creative visualization or meditation.

This technique produces results because it allows you to find out what
your prospect, your boss, your spouse, your customer, or your reader
wants. Why is this ability critically important? Every person in the world
has their mind tuned in to one radio station and one radio station only. Its
call letters are WIIFM, which stands for, What’s In It For Me. Your ability
to tune in to other people’s radio stations has a significant impact on your
success or failure in life. No matter where you are in life, no matter how
much money you make, no matter how happy or sad you are, no matter
your goals, your hopes, your dreams, or your desires, no matter whether
you want more money, more love, more peace, more happiness, or more
satisfaction, you must be able to meet the needs of other people in a way
they want so you can get what you want.

Satisfying other people’s wants—emotional, financial, spiritual, or any
other wants—the way they want them satisfied is how you get what you
want. It’s not the other way around. The bottom line is, to get what you
want, you first have to know what other people want and give it to them
(or sell it to them, as the case may be). If you’re going to change the
economic, social, or other circumstances of your life, other people play a
big part in helping you achieve that.

The number one objective of doing this exercise is to raise your level of
empathy with your customers or your prospects and tune in to their
WIIFM, their What’s In It For Me radio station. The word _empathy_ gets
misused most of the time you see or hear it. Webster’s defines empathy as
“A vicarious experience of the feelings, thoughts, or attitudes of another.”

Some people call it being in tune with another person or in sync.
Empathy means you feel and think about something the same way they
feel and think. By learning how to get into this empathetic state quickly,
you massively improve your ability to communicate with other people.
Maybe you’ve noticed this in yourself. I know I have. When I’m around
somebody that I have a high level of empathy for, I start talking like them,
taking on their mannerisms, and in some cases, taking on their accent,
speech patterns, and thought patterns. I noticed this about myself a long
time ago, when I was in a college at the fraternity house. I saw myself
doing it, but never understood why. I certainly didn’t understand the power


178


of using it to motivate others until much later.

Also, I have a background in the theater. Being able to empathize with
the person or the character you’re portraying is a big part of method acting.
That’s what we want. We want to play the role of a customer so well that
we end up becoming the customer. Then the customer will tell us exactly
what they want with the words, thoughts, and fears they have. We can then
use this information to sell them. This technique is powerful. Be careful
not to abuse it. You can and should learn to fully empathize with the
customer, the prospect, or anyone else you want to motivate in some way.
If you can get inside their minds, then you can feel their fear, and know
what you have to offer them, so they feel more secure.


If you can get inside their mind and feel their pain, then you’ll know
the relief they want. If you can get inside their mind and feel their
problems, then you can offer solutions that speak directly to their brain.
One of the things many copywriters miss out on is the fact that, if you can


179


identify a person’s emotional greed, which they are afraid to admit, then
you can offer them more of what they want.

This exercise will help you not only get in touch with what they want,
but also to get in touch with their fears, their pain, their problems, and their
innermost desires, so you can help them get what they want. Your ability
to do that will skyrocket your ability to communicate with these people
and motivate them to take the actions you want.

That’s the background of this technique. What makes this technique
even more effective is to do it after you’ve done a lot of research about
your prospects or customers. You’ve looked at the websites they go to.
You’ve read the magazines they read. You’ve watched the TV shows they
watch. You’ve seen the keywords they use when they search the internet.
You’ve done the intellectual research about your prospects, and you’ve got
these ideas running around in your head, but you still can’t connect with
them on a gut level. The perfect time to do this exercise is after you’ve
done that type of research. The more data you have about your target
audience, the more useful this technique will be. Like anything, the more
you practice it, the better you will get.

Before we get started, make sure the phone is off the hook, or the
ringer’s turned off. Make sure you have your cell phone on “do not
disturb.” Close your door. Make sure you’re not going to be interrupted.
Also, make sure you have an open and relaxed mind. Have a pen and paper
or an audio recorder handy. I prefer a recorder, so I use my cell phone with
a voice memo going while I’m practicing this. There will be things coming
out of your stream of consciousness that you want to record without
interrupting yourself to turn the recorder on and off.

The reason I prefer having a recorder is that once you enter the mind of
your prospect, you’ll be amazed at the stuff that comes out of you as you
start revealing what that person wants. You want to be able to capture all
of it because when you start rattling it off, it’s going to come out of your
subconscious quickly, and you don’t want to miss it.

Write down specific questions to ask yourself ahead of time. It sounds
weird, but it’s just like an interview. You don’t want to have to think about
the questions you want to ask after you’ve entered the mind of your
prospect. If you want to know what they’re afraid of, excited about, what
their problems are with something, then you want to have those questions
written out ahead of time so they can serve as a guide.

It also helps if you write down your intention for the interview. For
example, “My intention for conducting this session is to get in touch with
my prospect’s major problems and fears when it comes to writing their


180


book.”

Sit in a quiet place and close your eyes. Have the pen and paper or the
recorder handy. Your specific questions are written out and readily
available. Make sure you have enough space to write, or your phone
battery is charged. Then I like to count backward from ten slowly. Now,
with your eyes closed and your mind relaxed, feeling completely at ease
and safe, visualize yourself sitting in a big, comfy chair behind a huge,
ornate desk made out of teak or some other tropical, exotic wood.

Across the room from you is a door. The door opens and in walks
somebody who turns out to be your ideal prospect. They look concerned.
They have a problem they know you can solve, so they’ve come to consult
with you because they know you understand their wants, needs, desires,
and challenges. They take a seat across from you at the desk. In their
angst, they speak rapidly. Though they’re animated, you remain very calm
and still.

As they’re telling you about their problems, the stuff they want to
solve, and the desires of their heart, suddenly their voice starts to fade.
You realize you’re getting up out of your chair, gliding around the desk,
and you’re still perfectly calm. Everything’s cool. You get behind the
person while they’re still talking. As you move closer to them, you hear
their voice in your ears and look out through their eyes. It’s then you
realize you stepped inside the mind of your prospect.

You listen to what they say, and you see yourself across the desk. You
notice that you physically feel their fears. You feel their problems and
their desires. It’s this big, jumbled mass in the pit of your stomach. Then,
from the other side of the desk, where you still sit, you ask them the
questions on the paper. Because you’ve connected so entirely with the
mind of your prospect, the answers flow out of you. You capture
everything into your recorder or write it on the paper.

Some of the questions that lead to the kind of insight you’re looking for
are questions like:


What terrifies you?


What does that mean if that happens?


If you weren’t worried about anyone judging you, how would you
describe that fear in words anyone could understand?


What is your deepest desire for your life right now?


What objectives do you have for your business, or in building a
subscriber list, or in setting up your next funnel, or in trying to reach


181


financial freedom?


If I could provide that for you, what would you have to see, or what
would I have to say to motivate you to have a burning desire for what
I have to sell?


What words would you use to describe what I’m selling or what I
have to offer and how could I express that better in a way that would
resonate with you?


How badly do you want what I’m selling?


How could I make you want what I’m selling more?


What objections do you have to what I’m selling and what I can show
you or tell you to overcome those objections?


What would stop you from getting the results that I’m promising you
can get?


What could I do to sweeten the pot on my offer, my product, or my
service, so you feel comfortable and eager to take advantage of it
before I change my mind?


As you look at my competitors, what have you seen that you like, that
gets you excited, and that made you want to buy from them right
now?


What do I need to show you or prove to you that would turn you from
a prospect into a customer who does business for me, or with me?


What do you think is a fair price for what I have to sell?


What else can you tell me that will make what I have to offer even
more appealing to you?


What other problems or concerns do you have that I may not be
aware of or don’t realize are important to you?


Once you’ve finished with the questions, it’s time to draw the interview
to a close. However, don’t just open your eyes because that’ll jar your
mind.

You want to slowly pull back from your prospect and pull yourself out
the back of them. You find yourself floating peacefully and slowly back
around the desk and into yourself. Then you both sit there quietly, just
looking at each other, knowing you’ve been sincere, open, and complete in
your communication with each other.

Your prospect’s whole demeanor has changed since they entered the


182


room. They’re calm, cheerful, and feel better because they know you’ve
made a real effort to understand their problems, wants, and desires. Then,
with a big smile on your face and theirs, they get up, walk out of the room,
and shut the door.

With your eyes still shut, you start coming back feeling refreshed and at
peace. You come back up, ten, nine, eight—feeling more awake—seven,
six, five—feeling refreshed—four, three, two, one. Open your eyes.

Once you complete this exercise, you have some information and
insight you can use. I’ve had times of revelations, like, “Oh my gosh! I’ve
been looking at this completely the wrong way.” Or, I’ve had situations
where I had one tiny inflection, one word, one bit of pivot in the English
that I was using to explain something that made a huge difference. But I’ve
never done this exercise and not come away without some valuable insight
to help me better understand and be more empathetic toward the people
I’m trying to sell.

You can use this to understand how to meet their needs better. You can
use this to help create sales copy that speaks directly to their wants and
desires. You can modify your behavior when it comes to dealing with
them in virtually any situation, especially on social media, where people
can tend to piss you off. It’s nice to be able to draw on some level of
empathy which creates patience.

You can create a sale’s talk, a webinar, a phone script, or any other type
of interaction that’s more in sync with what’s going on in their head. Plus,
you can massively increase your understanding of what the other person
wants and sell it to them. If you do this, the insights you get as you
practice it are worth so much money to you because you’re able to get
inside their mind, use the words they use, and give yourself the
information to motivate them. The big thing to remember is not to think,
“Man, this is weird,” or “This is kind of stupid,” or “This is kind of
creepy.” This technique is proven. Just use it. Don’t get hung up on it.

Also, remember that the connection you can make with your customers
all starts in your mind. For those of us who sell through the internet, this is
going to sound woo-woo. But, if you think about it, you’re transmitting
thoughts from your mind through your screen and keyboard through the
internet to their monitor and keyboard. Those thoughts are what get people
to buy, sign up, and take action. It’s all about having that connection,
which starts in your mind. It’s your mind. You can play whatever games
you want. If you feel like this exercise is stodgy or weird, then it’s stodgy
and weird, and it won’t work for you.

But if you’re open, try to empathize and visualize through the eyes of


183


your customer. You can use this exercise to craft headlines, to figure out
bullets, to craft out a story, to write a sales letter, or whatever you’re trying
to do to suck people in and get them to take the action you desire. I use it
all the time.

Like the old saying says, “Never judge a man until you walk a mile in
his shoes.” Now you can do more than walk a mile in his shoes; you can
enter his mind and know what he’s thinking.


Summary:

Better copy comes from higher levels of empathy with your
customers and prospects.


Using a guided meditation like this helps you synthesize lots of
information and data through the eyes of your prospects.


If you think it’s weird, it won’t work. If you do it with an open mind,
your results could be truly life altering.

# **Secret #28** **The One And Only Purpose of An Online Ad**

_“The only purpose of an online ad is to get the right people to click and the wrong_

_people to keep on scrolling.”_

_Jim Edwards_


The only purpose of an online ad is to stop the right people in their tracks
and get them to click. (I could stop this secret right here and, if you just
took that last sentence to heart, you’d beat out 95% of your competitors).
Anything else, such as branding or the other BS people spout, is entirely
untrue. The only purpose of an online ad is to get the right people to stop
and click. That’s it.


You’ve seen those ads on Facebook or other sites. The courses that
promise to teach you the magic formula for writing ads. They’ve got the ad
that’s going make you rich. You used to see TV infomercials that had the
idea of little ads equal big profits. These ads promise to teach you to write
the perfect ad to bring an avalanche of customers on social media, on
Facebook, on LinkedIn, on Instagram, on Google AdWords, or even
through direct mail. They play on your hidden desire (and belief) that if
you could figure out that one perfect ad, you’d make a pile of cash.

These promises to deliver are enticing because you’ve probably failed
more than you’ve succeeded in your past ads without their magic formula.
Here’s the thing. If you’re honest, you secretly hate them for their success.
How do you feel about those ads that make you feel stupid because they
know how to create amazing ads and you don’t? How do you feel when


185


you see their pictures depicting their success?

Do you wonder if they’re good at running ads for everything, or are
they just good at running ads on Facebook for this high price course on
how to run ads on Facebook? If that sounds like your experience then trust
me, you’re not alone. I’ve been there too. Let me share with you a few
thoughts I’ve learned over the last 25 years of running ads online.

In this secret, there are five truths about ads. It’s like five secrets within
a secret. If that isn’t over-delivering, I don’t know what is.

### **The first truth about ads**


Again, the only purpose of an online ad is to get the right people to
click your link. I would rather have a hundred of the right people click my
link than ten thousand people who aren’t the right fit. That’s how you
waste money on ads.

If your ad targets the right kind of people, you pay a lot less money.
You spend less money because fewer people click on your ad. If more of
the right people click, your costs go down dramatically and quickly
because you’re not sending the wrong people through to your landing

page.

### **The second truth about ads**


Curiosity is key. It is the number one way you get the right people to


186


click. If your ad makes someone curious, you’ll get the click. That’s it.
Make them curious. The whole purpose of an ad is to get the right people
to click. In our attention deficit, attention-starved world where people give
you less time because they don’t have time to pay attention, the number
one thing that will get anybody to click your ad is curiosity.

What is it? How do they do that? Typically those are the two questions
you want to create in the mind of your potential customers so they will
click your ad.

### **The third truth about ads**


If you don’t know where to start when writing an ad, ask a question.
That’s all you have to do. Three basic questions serve me well when
crafting ads.


Are you tired of _____?


Would you like to _____?


Have you ever wanted to _____?


That is how you grab the attention of the right people in your target
niche and instantly eliminate the people who are not. (Notice, in the case
of these three questions we want to elicit a Yes answer.)

Examples: Are you tired of struggling to get traffic to your website?
Would you like to write a book? Would you like to write and publish a
book? Have you ever wanted to be an author?

Here’s the thing. If they say “yes,” you’ve grabbed their attention. Then
you use curiosity to get them to click. If they say “no,” they’re not going to
click your ad, so it doesn’t cost you anything. Is that an awesome win-win
bonus? Of course it is. Ask them if they’re tired of being in pain or living
in fear. Ask them if they’d like to get a powerful benefit or a cool payoff.
Ask them if they’ve ever wanted to do something cool.

Asking a question is the best place to start when writing ads, especially
if you’ve never written ads before. You can even use the question as your
headline in your ad.

A little side note for you. One day, I saw a graphical ad on Facebook
that blew my mind. It was a graphic with a one-line question in plain black
text on a white background. No image. The text was the image. It grabbed
my attention, so I clicked it. The person running the ad was a friend of
mine. His picture was plastered all over the front of the landing page. I


187


called him and asked, “Hey, dude, I saw your ad. How’s that going?” It
was offhand conversational, like guys do.

He told me he’s slaying it. I’ve adapted this technique to my existing
knowledge about using questions in my ads. In the past, I used pictures
with text to ask the question, but up to that point, I had never made the text
the image. Try it and see what kind of results you get.

### **The fourth truth about ads**


AIDA is BS. What the heck is AIDA? AIDA was, and still is, the gold
standard advice for offline print advertising. It’s an acronym for


Catch their Attention


Stimulate their Interest


Build their Desire


Drive them to Action


You need to grab somebody’s attention, usually with a headline. You
could pique their interest with a picture. Then, you stir their interest and
amplify their desire with a promise followed by an enticement to take
action.

AIDA was a perfect formula to get someone up off their butt, in their
car, and to your physical store. I am not saying that this doesn’t work. But
for online advertising, you don’t need it. Remember that the whole
purpose of an online ad is to get the right people to click on your ad.
That’s it.

You only need three steps. Step one is an attention grabber. You
typically do this with a headline in a text ad, a picture in an image ad or a
social media ad, or the first thing you do or show on the screen along with
the first words out of your mouth in a video ad.

Think about Facebook. Think about Instagram. Think about Twitter.
Think about LinkedIn. What makes you stop when you’re scanning
through those sites? It’s not the headline. It’s the picture. When watching a
video, your decision to keep paying attention happens in the first few
seconds. That’s why Facebook measures the metrics of success for a video
ad in three second views.

Therefore, what happens in the first three seconds of that video is the
most critical part of that entire video. Whether people stick around or bail
depends on what you say and show in the first three seconds. Use emotion


188


to grab their attention. Talk about payoffs or penalties. Talk about
outcomes or obstacles. Talk about the things they want or don’t want. You
want to go after emotion when you’re grabbing attention. You can’t be in
the middle. You can’t play it safe. You can’t try to be relevant to everyone.
You must force people to make a decision. You do that by showing
emotionally charged imagery, by using emotionally charged statements
and headlines. Emotion is key.

Step number two is to create curiosity. Show them a picture or text
designed to make them ask, “What is this? How can they do that?”

Step number three is a call to action. Tell them to do one specific thing.
Most of the time, online you’ll say, “Click here to _____.”

Let me give you some examples. Let’s say your target audience is
people who need help with financial planning. Their desire is financial
peace of mind or to get higher returns on their money. What’s their
problem? Wading through the confusing financial jargon or getting ripped
off by inept financial advisors.

Here’s some example ad copy:

If they say yes to the question, they’re thinking, “What is it?”

_financial jargon or getting ripped off by inept financial advisors._


“That’s me. I want higher returns on my money. Yeah, I want to see
that.”

_Click here now. Don’t hate yourself for getting ripped off by inept_

“Oh, man, I have to click.”
Whether they want to click or not, they have to click.
Here’s another example. The target audience is coaches who want to
market better to find more clients. They desire to get more coaching
clients, to make more money, and to enjoy more freedom as a coach.
What’s their problem? They’re losing money on marketing and wasting
time on prospects who won’t sign up for coaching.

Let’s look at some example ad copy.

Remember, the whole purpose of this ad is to get somebody to click.
_How to get more coaching clients._

Boom.
Let’s review the keys to a great ad that gets clicks from the right
people.


190


1. You use an emotional grabber.


2. You make sure that you have a curiosity driver.


3. Finally, there’s a clear call to action.

### **The fifth truth about ads**


It’s a numbers game. Selling more and making more money online with
ads is nothing more than a numbers game.

From my experience, it can take ten to fifty ad tests to find one that
works well enough to be profitable. Most people stop before they find the
one that works. They give up too soon.

“Oh, man, I ran every ad under the sun.”
“How many different ads did you run?”
“I ran a bunch.”
“Exactly how many campaigns did you run?”
“A couple.”
“Okay, how many ads were within each of those campaigns?”
“Two.”
They run two ads and decide ads don’t work. People who do that are
dumb. It is nothing more than a numbers game.

Running ads is like one of my favorite shows, Gold Rush, on the
Discovery Channel. That show is an excellent metaphor for running online
ads. The people on the show run millions of tons of dirt from areas they
believe have gold. They’ve done tests, so they know there’s gold in the
ground. They run the soil through these machines to extract little bits of
gold from each ton or “yard.” It’s just a giant sorting process.

The same is true with your online ads. It’s a giant sorting process.
These are the people you think are going to pay off for your business.
These are the ads you think your prospects will respond to. Now you run
the ads to those people and see what happens. If it works, keep doing it. If
it doesn’t work, then test somewhere else. If the test is promising, then run
a bunch of dirt through your machine.

Most of the people selling courses on ads don’t want to tell you it can
take ten to fifty ad tests because they know that sounds like work. Nobody
wants to buy work. The best thing you can do is burn through those ten to
fifty ads as fast as you can. Then, eliminate the poopers, find the few that
convert well, and scale those.


191


That’s the magic formula. I just boiled down everybody’s thousand
dollar writing ads course to: write ten to fifty ads using emotion, curiosity,
and drive to action, and run them. Get rid of the ones that don’t work. Find
the ones that do work and scale the crap out of those. The fact is nobody
ever runs one ad that is an instant hit. That’s not how it works. If you’ve
tried to run ads in the past and failed, don’t feel bad. Nobody knows which
ads will work until they finish running all the ads that don’t.


Oh, by the way, you never finish. It’s a never-ending process. Your ad
won’t work forever. Think of it this way: you have ads coming; you have
ads going; you have ads running right now. Think of it like a bucket
brigade. You have ads you are testing, ads you are running, and ads on
their way out the door. Don’t get emotionally attached to that process. It’s
just how it works.

In the old days, could you successfully run a single ad in magazines and


192


newspapers for years? Absolutely. Could you still do that today in print
publications? Absolutely. Online, though, ads have a limited shelf life,
especially on Facebook and other social media. Just because your ad is
working doesn’t mean you get to retire next Tuesday. You need to keep
testing. You need to keep figuring out new angles and emotional hooks to
use with your audience because it’s never over.

Change your copywriting mindset to one where you want to “fail fast”
with the losers and don’t give up until you find the winners. To borrow a
metaphor from the investing world, cut your losers and go long with your
winners. Don’t get emotionally attached to the process.


Summary:

The only purpose of an online ad is to get the right people to click
your ad.


The majority of the time, you have to test a LOT of ads to find the
few that work.


Once you find ads that work, don’t rest on your laurels. You still have
to come up with more ads to replace the ones you’re running that will
eventually stop working.


Grab attention. Build curiosity. Drive them to click . . . that’s the
magic formula for online ads.

# **Secret #29** **You Can’t Catch Fish Without A Hook**

_“Get the big point of your advertisement into your headline. Use your headline as_

_a hook to reach out and catch the special group of people you are trying to_

_interest.”_

_John Caples_


So, what’s a hook? How do you create one? Where and how do you use a
hook? A hook is an angle or a slant you use to create intense curiosity with
your target audience. That’s the key.

A hook’s purpose is not to sell, convince, or convert. It is only used to
induce curiosity. It pulls people into the rest of your sales copy.

Why do you want a good hook? You want to make your offer
memorable. A hook pulls people into your world quickly because where
the attention goes the rest will follow. If you capture their mind, the rest of
them follows. Your hook catches a person’s attention, causing them to
want more information. Using curiosity grabs them and gets them to give
you their undivided attention.

A hook is not a Unique Selling Proposition (USP). A Unique Selling
Proposition, also seen as Unique Selling Point, is a factor that
differentiates a product from its competitors. This differentiation could be
the lowest cost, the highest quality, or the first-ever product of its kind.
Think of a USP as what you have that competitors don’t. But that is not a
hook.


194


Now a USP can be significant to your success, especially when you’re
in a market with several competitors. A USP differentiates you as a
business. A hook distinguishes your sales message from all others.

So a Unique Selling Proposition is what makes your product or service
different from similar items. A hook is a lightning-fast story that creates
curiosity about that difference. So here’s an example. Here’s the hook:
“One-legged golfer outdrives Tiger Woods.” The USP could be, “Our
three-minute video fixes 90 percent of long drive problems.”

Another example. Hook: “The story of a 76-year-old man who got me
into the best shape of my life.” Because it’s an exercise product, the USP
might be, “Special bodyweight exercise you won’t see anywhere else but
in this course.” We capture their attention with the hook. But the USP
differentiates the actual product from all of our competitors.

Hooks are often “hidden” stories or angles. It’s important for you to
look for these. When it comes to your story or product, the hook is
sometimes difficult to identify because what other people think is cool,
you take for granted. Look for the hidden story in your offer that would get
people excited or at least curious.

Here are some hooks I’ve used through the years.


“Rebel Real Estate Agent.” Used to sell my book on how to sell your
[house yourself on fsbohelp.com.](http://www.fsbohelp.com)


“Mortgage Loan Broker blows the whistle on industry corruption.” I
used this for a mortgage product based on my past life as a mortgage
broker. The whole hook was blowing the whistle on people doing
shady things. Which, by the way, some of the practices I detailed in
my product ultimately were what brought about the financial crisis of
2008. That’s not revisionist history; it is the truth. I blew the whistle
on practices like charging extra fees or getting people loaded with
variable rates they couldn’t afford, ten years before it happened.


“From dead broke with a heart condition and living in a trailer park
with no heat and a leaky roof to internet millionaire.” Now, that’s a
hook I’ve used which has produced mixed results, but it’s got its
place.


How do you create a hook? The process is as much art as it is science.
I’ll give you a quick overview, and then I’ll show you a bunch of examples
because that’s where the art versus science comes in. A hook is often a
one-sentence story about you, about someone else, even about a fictional


195


character that’s like your prospect. It can also be a combination of
elements. Think of it this way: an unlikely character plus timing plus
results. Or, a result without pain plus timing. So what do I mean by this?
Let’s talk about the one sentence story real fast.


_**“How I used a simple hack to go from bankrupt and living in a trailer**_
_**park to become a successful real estate investor.”**_


That’s a hook I could use for a real estate investing course.


_**“Rookie realtor takes 52 listings first year in the business using this 15th**_
_**century discovery.”**_


You’re probably thinking, “What in the heck is that?” That’s the hook I
could use to talk about the fact that every realtor needs to have a book.
And what’s the 15 [th] -century discovery that this rookie realtor used? In
1440, Gutenberg invented the printing press. You might say, “Man, that’s
a stretch.” That’s a hell of a good stretch. It’s finding the creative story to
go with the hook. Any realtor will read that and say, ”A rookie took 52
listings their first year using a 15 [th] -century discovery? What is this? I need
to read more.”


That’s all we want.

Here’s another:


_**“Ex-pizza delivery guy shows you a weird trick to become a bestselling**_
_**author in a weekend.”**_


I could use this hook because I delivered pizzas for Domino’s for three
years. So I’m an ex-pizza delivery guy. I can show you a trick to become a
best-selling author on Amazon over a weekend. Absolutely can. Using
social media, your friends, and timed buying, I can show you how to
become a best-selling author actually in a day. But a weekend sounds
cooler.


And here’s one more:


_**“Meet Bob. Bob used a 1600-year-old secret to save his marriage, and**_
_**we’ll show you how.”**_


What in the world could be the 1600-year-old secret to saving your
marriage? You don’t have to explain it in the hook, but you use the hook to
pull them in.

You can also use a combination of elements using a formula. So let’s


196


look at an example of an unlikely character plus timing plus results.


_**“Former janitor goes from bankrupt to paid-off house in eighteen months**_
_**with profits from his e-book business.”**_


That is a hook I could use. I was a janitor at Giant Food during the
summer of 1986. When I was in college, I was a janitor. I used to get up at
four in the morning, ride my bike five miles, open up the grocery store,
and sweep and mop an entire grocery store by myself before they opened
at seven o’clock. And I did pay off my house with the profits from my ebook business. Granted, I was a janitor in 1986 and paid off my house in
2002. So I’m combining these different things. But it’s an authentic hook
to use. It will create an intense amount of curiosity.

Let’s look at another one.


_**“Part-time chicken rancher loses 30-pounds in two months thanks to the**_
_**unlikely combo of Oprah Winfrey and a former U.S. Navy Seal.”**_


Now again, this hook is my story. Part-time chicken rancher? Yep, we
have twelve chickens that I take care of every day. I did lose 30-pounds in
the last two months. As of this writing, I am 30-pounds lighter than I was
two months ago. But what’s with Oprah Winfrey? Oprah Winfrey is a big
supporter and business partner of Weight Watchers, and I used Weight
Watchers to manage my diet and lose the weight. And then the former U.S.
Navy Seal is Stew Smith, my friend who has been training me for the last
five years.


197


Do you see the art in taking these elements and combining them into a
hook? Your mind can’t help but think, “Holy crap! What is that?” That’s
the only response. Your brain almost disconnects, so you stop any selfcontrol and have to know what it is.

Let’s look at another formula. Result plus timing minus pain.


_**“Lose all the weight you want in the next thirty days without diet or**_
_**exercise.”**_


What? That’s what they’re looking for! Or that’s what they think
they’re looking for until they find out it’s the methamphetamine diet.


_**“Create and publish your outrageously profitable book in just three hours**_
_**without writing a single word.”**_


That’s a great hook as well and entirely possible to do.
Where and how do you use a hook? Use it as your headline. You can
use it in your sales copy. Use it at the beginning of your sales copy. You
can use it in the first paragraph. Use it in your stories. You can use it in
your ads and social media posts. Use it in your memes and infographics.
You can use it anywhere you want to grab people’s attention. That’s the
beautiful thing about a hook; use it anywhere and everywhere. Use it
anywhere to grab people, pull them in, and move them on to the next step.


Summary:

A hook is basically a one-sentence story you can use to grab attention
and create intense curiosity at the same time.


Hooks are as much art as they are science.


You can use formulas to combine different elements to create

effective hooks.

# **Secret #30** **Create Your Own Swipe File**

_“Get yourself a collection of good ads and DM (direct mail) pieces and read them_

_aloud and copy them in your own handwriting.”_

_Gary Halbert_


Whether you’ve heard of it or not, all copywriters worth their salt maintain
something called a “swipe file”. What is a swipe file? A swipe file is a
collection of advertisements, postcards, direct mail, catalogs, posters,
flyers and anything that has to do with selling somebody something. In the
past, it was built around direct mail, brochures, or something you received
in print.


199


But, why do you need one? When you sit down to write sales copy,
most people can’t flip a switch and instantly start writing sales copy. Just
like when you work out, any good routine includes a warmup, something
to get your blood going, something to get your muscles warmed up,
something to get your juices flowing. You need to be in the proper mindset
to write copy. A quick way to get into the mindset is to read good copy.
Whether it’s copy you’ve written that’s worked well in the past, or swipe
file copy of other people’s sales copy, read some to get warmed up. If you
need to write some headlines, a simple way to get those patterns flowing is
to read some. Same goes for emails, offers, and entire sales letters.

How does it help you? Your mind warms up with patterns that you
know work. You won’t have stuff in your swipe file that didn’t grab your
attention, or you don’t know for a fact is getting results.

Who should have a swipe file? Everybody. If you’re reading this, you
need a swipe file.

How do you keep it? Well, there are two ways. You can create a digital
file folder or a print one.

You can quickly develop a digital swipe file, and I encourage you to do
so. Capture screenshots of things you see that you like or save the entire
webpage. I use a program called Snagit by TechSmith, who also makes
Camtasia. Snagit allows me to capture everything from just a single image
to an entire scrolling webpage. I save those in folders with sub-folders like


200


ads, headlines, calls to action, stories, and bullets. When I want to get my
warmup, I flip through these quickly and view them as graphics on my
hard drive.

For a print file, I keep them in manila folders organized into emails,
headlines, sale’s letters, my stuff and other people’s stuff. I’ve even bound
some things with a comb binder. You don’t have to do that. How do you
use it? Use it as a mental tickler file every time you need to do something.
If you need to write headlines, look at some headlines. If you need to write
bullets, look at bullets. If you need to write a sales letter, look at the sales
letters.

Funnel Scripts started out as my interactive swipe file with no intention
to sell it. It was my little secret weapon I used to create content or to create
sales copy for webinars, special offers, product launches, or emails. What
used to take me two, three, four hours or even days to put together now
took about fifteen or twenty minutes. It felt like cheating to use this
software (and it still does).

When do you add to your swipe file? The answer is whenever you see
something that grabs your attention! I remember seeing a video game
magazine, on the front row in Books-A-Million in Williamsburg, Virginia.
One of the bullets said, “The Grand Theft Auto Vice City secrets you’re
not supposed to know.” My brain immediately replaced the Grand Theft
Auto Vice City secrets with e-book marketing. I used the headline, “The
E-Book Marketing Secrets You’re Not Supposed To Know” to help launch
a six-figure website. I still remember the picture on the cover. It was a
cartoon of a woman eating a Tootsie Pop. It was a very provocative cover
that grabbed my attention. Any time you see something, take a picture of it
with your smartphone, email it to yourself, and add it to your digital swipe
file. It’s never been easier to create and maintain a swipe file than it is
today.

Finally, when should you start a swipe file? The answer is “Right
now!” Because if you don’t have a swipe file, you put yourself at a severe
disadvantage. Of course, you can use [FunnelScripts.com, and I would](http://www.FunnelScripts.com)
highly encourage you to do that. However, having your own swipe file of
everything from blog post titles, to intros, to entire paragraphs, to just
about anything else where you’re writing sales copy will help you shortcut
the process and save a ton of time. That’s the who, what, why, when,
where, and how, of having your swipe file. If you don’t have one, you
need one. If you do have one, use it.


Summary:


201


Swipe files get your sales copy juices warmed up and going, just like
working out.


A swipe file can contain anything you see that grabs your attention
and works.


Your swipe file does NOT have to be industry specific. I use
inspiration from video game magazines all the time to apply to my
business.


If you don’t have a swipe file, start one. If you do have a swipe file,
use it!


202


# **Secret #31** **Polish Your Sales Copy**

_“‘Finish your first draft and then we’ll talk,’ he said. It took me a long time to_
_realize how good the advice was. Even if you write it wrong, write and finish your_

_first draft. Only then, when you have a flawed whole, do you know what you have_

_to fix.”_
_Dominick Dunne_


You want to make it shine, Baby. When it comes down to making money,
people judge your copy. People judge you by the quality of the words you
say. Do a grammar check. Do a spelling check, a punctuation check, and a
formatting check. You want to make sure that, when someone’s reading or
watching or listening, you don’t stick your foot in your mouth and sound
like an idiot. And whether we like it or not, or agree with it or not, typos
and grammatical errors, errors in what you say, errors in layout, funky line
breaks, all cause people to judge you negatively.

If you don’t take the time to proofread your sales message, what are


203


you telling your audience about the quality of your product? If you’re
selling information, training, or coaching, people judge your level of
professionalism by your grammar, spelling, punctuation, and formatting.
It’s true. Get over yourself and stop thinking it doesn’t matter. It does.

Check how your copy looks or your video plays in every different web
browser—Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer. You need to see how
it looks and plays.

I first learned this lesson in 1996 when I started my web design
business. A website and sales copy I created for a real estate broker looked
perfect on my monitor. Excited to show it to him, I drove to his house,
pulled it up on his computer monitor, and it looked like crap. It had a gray
background, and all the pictures looked like crap because his monitor
resolution was different. That’s when it smacked me in the mouth, and I
realized, “Oh my God. I almost lost this account, because I didn’t check to
see how it would look to everybody.”

Since that day, I always check my copy on different browsers.
Whenever I forget, it turns around and bites me on the ass. You need to
check to see how it looks.

You also need to check on different operating systems, including PC,
Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android, and Linux. Why? Because how the message
looks, how the copy displays on somebody’s device is not their fault. It’s
our fault. If it looks good, we can take the credit. If it looks bad, we take
the blame. Check how it looks under every conceivable condition, so you
don’t sabotage your copy because it looks like crap.

The next thing you want to check is the secondary reading path. With
text, this means you scan your copy and see if you can get the basic
message. Read the headline, your sub-headlines, and the P.S., which is the
secondary reading path for long-form sales copy or print sales copy.
People scan; they don’t read. Can you get the gist of your sales message
from reading the headline, scanning any sub-headlines, scanning the
bolded words, looking at the pictures, and reading the P.S.? If not, you
have some work to do. You should be able to make a compelling case with
your copy when people scan it on a secondary reading path.


204


Here’s something I guarantee most people don’t do. Watch your video
sales letter with the sound turned off. Does it still work? Now I can hear
the groans through the pages: “Oh my God. Why would anybody watch a
video with the sound turned off?” All videos on Facebook start playing
with the sound muted. You want to have subtitles for your videos.
Rev.com will do those for you for a dollar a minute, which is well worth
the investment. All your video sales letters from now on should have
subtitles so when people watch your video with the sound turned off, they
will get the message.

One more thing about auto-play videos. I mentioned in another secret
that the internet has declared war on auto-play videos. Chrome has taken it
to the next level, and I’m sure other browsers will as well. If your sound is
turned on, Chrome will not auto-play your video. It will automatically
pause it, even if it’s set to auto-play.

Another reason you want to make sure your video sales letter will work
with the sound turned off is that a lot of people will watch your video at
work where they can’t listen. They’re sitting in their cubicle with no
speakers and couldn’t hear your video even if they wanted to!

Now, get a second pair of eyes on your copy, or a second pair of ears
and eyes for your video sales letter. That second pair of eyes will catch the
typos, the grammatical errors, the issues with playing the video, or the
video not playing, or not behaving properly. Nothing beats somebody else


205


using their computer to review your sales message and ferreting out any
sort of technical issues.

There’s a story about a copywriter who always gave his sales letters to
his friends. His litmus test was if they didn’t ask to buy whatever was in
the sales letter, then he went back to the drawing board. The idea was that
your sales copy has to be so good that you could hand your sales letter to
somebody, and if they say, “Hey, great sales letter,” it means your sales
letter sucks. The only acceptable response is for them to read your sales
letter and say, “Ooh, where can I buy that?”

Now this story may be an urban myth to a degree. Unless the people
you give your copy to are in your target market, there’s really no reason
for them to buy. So copying this idea as your litmus test for good copy
might not be wise.

On the flip side, if you have some customers you feel comfortable
asking to review your sales copy who then ask, “Hey, this is cool, when
are you coming out with this?” that’s a great sign. But unless that’s the
case, you probably won’t have people who proof your sales copy respond
with: “Where can I get one?”

Also, don’t get caught up in the throw-it-against-the-wall mentality.
Because of the way everything works online, speed is often valued more
than thoughtfulness or methodical-ness. Your language matters. Your
grammar, spelling, punctuation, and formatting matter too. Don’t just
throw it against the wall and then say the people who are not responding
are stupid. They’re not stupid. These are the people you’re trying to get to

pay you money.

Finally, when it comes to polishing your copy, think about the slippery
slide test. When someone starts your sales message, you want them to go
through the whole thing and end up splashing down into the money pool
without any problems. Read your copy from the standpoint of the slippery
slide. Is there anything in the copy, whether it’s visual, grammatical, the
way that it reads, or the way that it sounds, that causes friction? Your copy
should feel like a conversation with no funny breaks or jarring movement
from one thought to another. Does each section flow into the next? When
you get to the end of one section, have you segued well into the next one?
If not, smooth out the language so it flows.

That’s it. That’s how you make your copy shine.


Summary:

People judge your sales copy by the format, form, grammar, spelling,
and punctuation as much as they do the content.


206


Get a second pair of eyes on your copy to look for errors.


Ensure your secondary reading path makes sense. People should be
able to skim your sales copy and get the gist of your sales message in
a compelling way.


Watch your video sales letters with the sound turned off. Would you
still buy?

# **Everything Else You Need To Know About** **Sales Copywriting**

We covered some great stuff in those secrets. But before we finish, here
are some additional questions I get asked every time I teach these
copywriting secrets.

### **What makes copywriting different from regular writing?**


It’s your intention. What is your purpose when you’re writing? Do you
want to entertain? Are you trying to convey information only, or do you
want people to take some specific action?

Copywriting leads someone to take a specific action. That action can be
to click a link, to buy something, to fill out a form, to opt-in for something,
to request a phone call, or to make a phone call. When you think about it
from this standpoint a lot more things are copywriting than you realize.

Blog posts are copywriting.
Facebook posts are copywriting
Instagram posts are copywriting.
Even memes are copywriting if you use them certain ways.
If you create content and your intention is to get somebody to click a
link, to go to a specific page, to request information, to fill out a form, to
opt-in, to request a phone call, or to make a phone call, then all these
things are copywriting.

So, I think it would be wise to expand your definition of what
copywriting is, and look at what you’re doing on a regular basis as
copywriting, rather than just writing or creating content.

### **How much has the art/science of copywriting changed over** **the years?**


That’s an interesting question. I can only answer the question from the
time I started to write the ads at the bank that made the compliance
department rip their hair out up through today. That’s a 25-year span.

A significant change is you don’t get as much time with people today.
It used to be that you could give more information and keep people’s
attention. Now, in the online world, you only have a few seconds to grab


208


people’s attention and hold their attention.

Secondly, curiosity seems to be a lot more important than it was. I think
that’s linked to the amount of time you do and don’t have to get and keep
people’s attention. So you’ve got to be faster to stimulate people and pull
them in. You also have to get to the point quicker.

As far as how is it the same? You are still solving people’s problems,
satisfying desires, showing them you can help them change their situation
for the better. I don’t think that’s ever going to change. Go back and
review Secret #3 for the top ten reasons why people buy. That was a gamechanger for me in my copywriting career. Instead of talking in generalities,
if I knew why people were going to want to buy, that made writing copy a
lot easier because it gave me a focus, a filter, and a framework.

### **What, in your opinion, makes the copy so good they can’t** **refuse to buy?**


The short answer is your copy makes them believe they’re going to get
the result they want from what you’re selling. So, if they believe that
they’re going to solve their problem, going to get their desire, going to
make that money, save that money, save that time, avoid that effort, escape
that pain, or whatever it is, they can’t refuse to buy . . . if they believe.

It comes down to hooking them, to having an emotional appeal. It
comes down to having the proof that you can deliver not only for yourself
but also for them. That’s the mental checklist that people run down. First,
does this work? Second, has this worked for other people? Third, do I
believe it will work for me?

Sometimes it can be as simple as a demo. The person sees how the
product works and believes they could push the button that way or use the
product that way. Other times, it’s as complicated as having the proper
case studies, using the right words, and having data to back you up.

But mainly it’s the mental checklist people run down. “Do I believe it’s
possible to get this result?” “Have other people gotten the result?” “Do I
believe that I can get the result?” So that’s the short answer.

### **Should you write the copy before you make or create or** **manufacture the product or service?**


I believe whenever possible, you should craft the perfect offer before
you create whatever it is you’re going to sell.


209


When you write copy for a product that already exists, your critical
brain kicks in and says, “Does it do that?” Or, if you make a claim about
something or give information, you think, “Well, yeah, I guess it does that,
but am I stretching it?” These thoughts cause you to equivocate in your
copy, which is a fancy way to say you tone down the promises in the copy
because you’re worried the product won’t live up to the promise. So I’m a
huge advocate of creating the ultimate offer, the best sales copy, and then
developing the product that meets or, preferably, exceeds the promises
made. The copy becomes the blueprint for the creation of the product
rather than a spec sheet.

That’s easy to do when you’re talking about an information product or
training because you nail everything in the sales copy, and then you make
sure you teach everything you promised. With a physical product, it’s still
possible. You need to design the ultimate thing people want to buy, and
then you manifest it as a physical product in the real world. Now, will you
run into restrictions, especially with a physical product? Probably. But it’s
always easier to go back and say, “Okay, maybe we need to adjust this one
little spot in the copy.” or you say, “You know what? I’m committed to
making this work no matter what, and we’re going to find a way to make
this happen. Let’s modify the product until we can keep this promise!”

This is a wonderful strategy for creating copy that sells like crazy. If
you create your offer, write your sales copy, your sales letter and your
sales video before you create an information product, this is an easy
process. You just create the ultimate offer and then fulfill it. It’s the same
thing with software. It’s better to build the sales copy for a piece of
software before you develop it because that forces you to make sure all the
features you needed to sell it are in there. It gives you the strength and
purpose when you inevitably run into a programmer who says, “It would
be easier if we didn’t have this. Is this feature essential?” If you have it as
part of your public sales plan, you say, “Yes, this feature is necessary; let’s
get that done.”

Do the same thing with a service. A service doesn’t get delivered until
after you’ve sold it. So make it sound amazing in your sales copy, and then
deliver on the promise you’ve made to sell it.

### **How can I get good at copy fast?**


The answer is the P word: “practice.” The way to get good at something
fast is you have to try. Then once you try, you have to be bad, and then
you can be good, and then you can be great. The only way to be great is


210


first to be good. The only way to be good is first to be bad. And the only
way to be bad is first to try.

I suggest you write or create some copy every single day, but don’t sit
on it. Put some eyeballs on it and see what kind of a reaction you get.
What do people think? What do people do? Or do people do nothing? The
only way you will get better is to see whether people come across with
money or opting in, or by clicking the link, or dialing the phone.

That’s it. That’s what you need to do. If you want to get good, you have
to be bad. Before you can be bad, you have to try. That means putting stuff
out there, trying to get people to take action, and then measuring and
observing. Observe, “When I do this, this happens; when I tweak this, this
happens.” That’s how you get better. It becomes an upward spiral.

### **How long did it take you to become an expert at** **copywriting?**


I’ve been writing copy for over 25 years, but I am not an expert at
copywriting. I consider myself to be good at selling. As soon as you
consider yourself an expert, you stop asking questions. In the world of
sales, you have to keep asking questions. You have to be able to say,
“Wait. What’s working right now? What’s not working anymore?” You
have to pay attention to what’s going on. You must ask questions like, “I
wonder what would happen if we tried this?” Those seem to be the
questions that keep us moving down the trail, seeing what’s working and
what’s stopped working, and trying a whole bunch of new things.
Remember, trying leads to bad, which leads to good, which leads to great.
Very seldom do you get to great, but good can get you paid too.

Also, operating from the standpoint of “How can I help people?”
instead of “How can I sell people?” “How can I add value to the point
people want to pay me? So they feel compelled to pay me? Or feel guilty if
they don’t pay me?” Those are great questions to ask.

Be very careful about considering yourself an expert at anything. It’s
much better to consider yourself a student of copywriting. How long does
it take you to become an actual student of copywriting? The answer to that
is the instant you decide to be one. That would be how I would reframe
that question. You need to be careful about declaring yourself an expert at
anything. The only thing I know I’m genuinely expert at is making
mistakes. I’m friggin’ good at that. For everything else, I try to be a good
student.

### **How do you structure sales copy and headlines for a** **seriously boring commodity product with no obviously** **result-based opportunity, like credit card terminal paper** **rolls?**

Now, this is pretty boring. I want you to think about the poor schlep
who has to buy this commodity. The question that I ask is, “What’s the
emotion attached to it?” Thinking about credit card terminal paper rolls or
something equally as dull, what are the feelings somebody has? What
makes them unhappy or even super angry? What do they daydream about?
What are their problems with this commodity that make whatever it is
even worse?

This reminds me of a one-sided conversation I had with my
homeowner’s insurance agent. We met the guy once, signed all the
paperwork, had three houses with him, four cars, a boat, a four-wheeler, a
tractor, and an umbrella policy. It was a massive amount of insurance. I
received a letter from the insurance company directly, not from him, that
told me they were canceling the insurance on one of my investment
houses.

I called him and asked, “Why are they doing this?” It was some stupid
thing that could be easily corrected. I said to him, “Your job is to stay off
my radar. I shouldn’t have to think about what I’m doing with you. I
should not have to worry about what the insurance is covering and whether
it’s working or not and whether you’re going to give me any crap or not.”

He said, “What do you mean?”
I said, “Your job is to stay off my radar. That’s your job. I know that
you’re there if I need you, but you should not be causing me one iota of a
problem.”

I was a jerk about it, but it pissed me off that they sent me a letter
telling me they were going to cancel the insurance on one of my houses,
when I had been paying them $10,000 a year in premiums for over 15

years.

The reason I tell that story is because when it’s something that’s boring,
perhaps the angle is, “We do what we need to do, we don’t aggravate you,
and we make it so you can move on with your life with one less thing to
worry about.” So perhaps the angle for this is to play up the fact that it’s
boring. Play with it. Say, “You know what? The last thing anybody wants
to think about is buying paper for the credit card terminal until you’ve got
a line of ten people waiting at the register, and you see the purple stripe


212


show up on the credit card receipt. When you reach for a replacement roll,
you find you don’t have one. That’s the time you don’t want to think about
credit card terminal paper rolls.”

Also, bring up an emotional situation where they see that they
should’ve paid attention to the credit card terminal paper roll issue. That
could be worth exploring. You want to look for the emotion, for the story,
for the case study, for the situation where it stops being a boring
commodity product. Then show the prospect without the commodity, it’s a
major pain in the butt. Lead with that.

### **How do I find a better balance between this is about you and** **how awesome you’ll be when you buy my thing, and my** **thing is really awesome and you should buy it?**


The last thing you ever want to talk about is you and your product until
you have talked about them and their problem, them and their future, them
and their desires, hopes, and dreams. It starts with them. Whether it’s the
before/after/bridge, the problem-agitate-solve, or the benefit, benefit,
benefit, then do this, whichever of those three techniques you use. It’s all
about them to begin with, then you transition into how your product, your
service, your software, your information helps them get more of what they
want or less of what they don’t want, or both.

You lead with them. The story is about the customer. The sales copy is
about them. That’s how you do it. You don’t start talking about your thing.
You talk about them. It’s like that Toby Keith song, “I like talking about
you, you, you, you usually, but occasionally I wanna talk about me.” Well,
you should talk about them a whole lot more than you talk about yourself,
especially at the beginning of your sales copy.

### **Does fear-based negative headline/copy content convert** **better than positive headline/copy content?**


When you are talking about cold traffic, yes, a negative headline or
fear-based headline, a headline that enters the conversation that’s already
going on inside of their head revolving around their problem or pain, will
typically convert better. Why? Because it grabs and holds their attention.
Remember, cold traffic is people who know they have a problem but have
no idea if there’s a solution out there. Also, they don’t know about you or
your product (yet).


213


When we’re talking about warm traffic, these are people who are
looking for a solution. They know there has to be a solution out there
somewhere. So you can’t lead with fear-based, because they’re looking for
a solution. You have to phrase your headline around the solution, so they
know they’ve found what they are looking for.

With hot traffic, you not only phrase it around the solution, but also you
phrase it around yourself and your product. They already know who you
are and what you’re offering. You’re trying to get them to make that
buying decision now.

Now, with the warm and the hot, you can then use a takeaway close,
where you say something like, “Now, this isn’t for everybody. We’re only
looking for specific people who want to _____.” And they think, “Whoa.
Wait a minute. what do you mean this isn’t . . . ?”

This type of takeaway is popular now and referred to as FOMO—fear
of missing out. However, you induce this fear of missing out, that’s where
you can use a negative later in your sales copy to get people to take action
because they’re afraid they will miss out.

### **How to take a client’s boring offer and sexify the living poo** **out of it?**


I like that. Sexify. The number one thing that sexifies an offer is
emotion. You’ve heard this before, and it’s absolutely true. People buy on
emotion, and they justify on logic. So if you can amp up the passion, that
amps up the buying power.

When I look at most people’s sales copy, they talk about features.
Sometimes they talk about benefits. But, rarely do they talk about
meaning, which is where all the emotion is located.

Find the meaning and the emotion, and amp it up. Turn up the volume
to either push them or pull them. The emotion creates motion.

### **I’m in addiction. Lots of pain and lots of shame/fear. How do** **I keep moving people to buying but not be overly pushy?**


There are many different things you can do, but my suggestion is to use
future pacing. Future pacing involves asking questions like, “What will
your life be like if you don’t stop drinking?” “What is your life going to be
like if you don’t stop taking drugs?” “What is going to be the impact on
your kids if you keep doing this behavior?” “What’s going to happen to


214


your marriage in the next two, three, four, five, or six months?” “Will you
even still be married?” “Will you be out on the street?” You don’t have to
be pushy to get the emotion amped up to the point where they’re looking
for any kind of help.

Another thing you can do is meet them where they are. “Hey, do you
have a drinking problem? All right, well, lots of people do. Let’s talk
frankly for a minute. What’s going to happen if _____? What if _____?”
Then you move to, “Now, that’s pretty bleak. Yep, that sucks. Now, I want
to ask you something else. What would happen if we got this handled?
What would your life be like if you did quit drinking? What would your
life be like if you did stop taking drugs? What would your life be like if
you stopped being abusive to your spouse?”

Paint that picture of raising them up and then here’s the product, here’s
the offer, here’s the solution. “The great news is you’ve already taken the
first step, which is to realize you need to get some help. So, all you need to
do is get started, and that is the hardest step. So, when you push that
button, you can smile because you’re on your way to recovery.” Take them
on that journey. If there’s lots of shame, you have to shame them a little bit
more. But then you help them get past the shame. If there’s fear, you
intensify the fear and then help them get past the fear. If the shame is bad
enough, they will do something about it. If the fear is bad enough, they
will do something about it. You have to make it worse and show them
what the world is going to be like if they don’t change. Once you’ve done
that, then you throw out the life ring and say, “Hey, it doesn’t have to be
that way. I want you to see what life can be like in a very short time if we
get this handled.” That is how I would handle this type of situation.

### **How do I ensure my copy flows from step to step in the** **funnel and is consistent without being repetitive? How much** **of the same language should be used at each level?**


This is interesting because this is a phenomenon I see all the time.
People understand they need a landing page, some emails, a confirmation
page, and a one-time offer page. They look at these different pages in their
funnel and think that all the sales copy has to be different. However, you
want to have a consistent message. You want to use the same words. The
funny thing is, your emails can have the same language as your sales copy.
The words on the page can be the same words that are in your video sales
letter.


215


Don’t reinvent the copy wheel. Use the same copy over and over. The
more they see it, the more there’s a level of familiarity and comfort that
reinforces the message.

The other thing is to make sure that, as you transition from your
confirmation or your one time offers, to your down sells, stylistically,
everything looks the same. It’s obvious the person is still on the same
website. It’s obvious it’s still the same person talking to them. It’s obvious
this is still part of the same conversation.

It needs to look the same, read the same, and work the same all the way
through your funnel, even beginning with your ads, emails, or however
you’re driving traffic. It should all be congruent, using the same words,
similar pictures. Stylistically everything looks the same. Otherwise, you
create confusion. And not just confusion, you cause uneasiness.

### **Any techniques or value in using local vernacular for copy? I** **recently was told my professional copy didn’t fit the** **millennial audience.**


When we talk about entering the conversation that’s going on in their
head, that means using the words they use because, otherwise, you’re
using the wrong words. So, this is good advice. You need to use the words
your audience uses. It may be local vernacular, or it may be certain buzz
words or keywords or phrases, so they know you are talking directly to
them. You don’t want them to feel like they’re being talked down to, or on
the flip side, like you’re an idiot who doesn’t understand what they’re all
about.

It’s important that you use those words, but it’s also crucial that you are
genuine and don’t overdo it. Targeting millennials, you shouldn’t write
like you’re a 13-year-old kid, but you also shouldn’t write like you’re a 50year-old out-of-touch adult. Sprinkle in the right buzzwords, the keywords,
the phrases that will let people know you really do understand them.
Rather than using slang terms or local vernacular, make sure you use the
words they use to make it work.

### **Why do some words or phrases connect better with some** **people than others?**


The answer is the words that connect the best are the words they use. If
you’re using words they don’t use, don’t understand, or don’t identify


216


with, then you’re not going to connect at all.

Some other things you can do to connect better with people is to use
verbs in your headlines. Why would you use verbs in your headlines?
Verbs create mental pictures, which force people to imagine something.

Here’s a quick example: “How to write and publish your own
outrageously profitable e-book.” “How to write” and “publish” causes you
to visualize it. Now think about another headline. “How to be a published
author.” That’s a little bit harder to visualize. This comes down to active
versus passive writing. Search Google for active versus passive writing.
Active writing uses active verbs; passive writing uses verbs such as is, am,
was, were, and be. The _to be_ verbs don’t create motion inside people’s
heads. Instead, you come across as wordy and unclear. An active voice is
clear, direct, and doesn’t beat around the bush. People get the message
quickly. There are many courses available on active versus passive
writing. Go check them out. I’m sure there are some free ones.

The other thing is to use copy connectors, which are transitions
between blocks of copy. What do I mean? I used a copy connector there
with the phrase _what do I mean_ . Let me explain. That’s another copy
connector (let me explain). Use little phrases like that to connect various
parts of your copy.

Another one is _for example_ . For example . . . When you transition
between the part of your copy where you introduce the solution with
several bullets, then you might have a transition like, “At this point, you
might wonder, who am I to make these claims about being able to help you
with writing your book?” That’s a copy connector. You would then show
them, demonstrate, or tell them about yourself and your accomplishments.
After you do that, you might use a copy connector like, “But don’t just
take my word for it, take a look at this.” Or you might say “But I’m not the
only one . . .” That connector introduces the testimonials or case studies
section of your copy.

“Now, at this point, you might wonder how much this will cost?”
That’s where you introduce the price, do the price drop. Then you can say
something like, “But before you make a decision, let me sweeten the pot
even more,” and you introduce your bonuses. Now you transition from the
bonuses to your final call to action or the guarantee. Let’s say you want to
go to the guarantee. “Now, you’re 100% covered with our money back
guarantee.” Then after the guarantee, you could say, “The choice is yours.
It’s time to get started.” Then you go into the summary. At the end, you
might use a connector like, “Oh, one more thing,” to introduce everything
at the end with a P.S., “Now it’s time to choose.”


217


If you think of this as one big conversation, which it is, this is a way to
make your copy flow.

Several people tell me they don’t read long Facebook posts. I wonder if
it is because the posts are long or they don’t connect to the long content
together very well? It doesn’t matter whether you’re talking about long
posts on Facebook, long articles, long sale videos, long webinars, or long
sales letters. The people who are interested will read, watch, and listen.
The people who are not interested will not. Target your people effectively,
so the right people see your message.

If nobody reads your long posts or sales letters or watches or listens to
your long video sales letters, then your target is wrong, or your sales copy
sucks, and you need to shorten it. Don’t get emotional about it. Change it.
This is part of the getting good at sales copy. If it’s not working, don’t try
harder to make it work by saying, “We need to run more ads.” Maybe you
need to change who sees it. If that doesn’t work, then you need to say,
“You know what? Let’s try something different. Let’s try something
shorter. Let’s try a different tack. Let’s try a different headline. Let’s try a
different offer. Let’s try a different call to action.” Just try something
different.

Avoid being a whiny little punk that says, “Well, this doesn’t work. I
must not be good at writing sales copy, and long copy doesn’t work.” No.
_Your_ long copy doesn’t work. That’s the difference. Own it. Try something
else. See if you can get the result you want. So, if quite a few people tell
you they don’t read long posts on Facebook, that’s great. Are they in your
target audience? Have they bought something? Consider the source.

### **How do you use curiosity in your sales copy quickly, easily,** **and without pissing people off?**


Don’t use curiosity that is not related to your offer or your sales copy.
The classic example is a headline “Sex” in giant letters. Then it says,
“Okay, now that I’ve got your attention, let’s talk about the world’s
greatest dishwashing detergent.” Unless you’re into some weird sex,
dishwashing detergent has nothing to do with sex, and people end up
pissed off.

Bait and switch uses curiosity in a way that pisses off people. So don’t
do it. Use curiosity to make people more “thirsty”, more excited, and more
interested in whatever you sell and whatever is in your sales message. A
good example would be, “Could you write a book in three hours? Is that


218


possible? Believe it or not, it’s true and entirely possible. Let me show you
how.” That’s curiosity-inducing and real.

Ask a question that seems beyond the realm of reality, but ask it in a
_what if_ way. “What if you could have the credibility of being a published
author and only take three hours of total work to do it? Would that be cool
or what? Well, believe it or not, it’s true, and I can prove it.” That will get
some people interested in your sales copy. Lead with a question that has an
outlandish, but supportable, claim.

As an aside, by asking it as a question, you can avoid trouble with the
censors over at Facebook and Google because all you’re doing is asking a
question rather than making a claim.

Write what the target needs wrapped up in what they want, so it
resonates. People buy what they want. Rarely do they buy what they need.
Examples: “I want the latest Xbox game.” “I want to lose weight, but I
need to eat healthily.” “I really want to eat a cheeseburger more than I
want to lose weight.” The problem is that people buy what they want. But
the great thing is also that people buy what they want. You just sell them
what they want and include what they need to get results (if they’re willing
to take action).

Whatever they want, sell it to them! But package what they want with
what they need, so they get an authentic result. Just don’t talk about the
need much in your sales copy, because they don’t care!

### **What can we do to keep people engaged and reading our** **copy?**


Use pictures that keep them moving along.


Break up the text with bold bullets.


Don’t have big blobby paragraphs. Paragraphs should only be two,
three, or four lines long max. Pretty much a sentence is a paragraph
when I’m writing copy for the web.


Keep it moving.Keep it about them, meaning it’s focused on them,
their story, their needs, their desires, and their problems.


Phrase everything about yourself and your product as it benefits them,
how it helps them, how it enriches them, how it will improve their
lives, and how it will alleviate pain or dissipate fear. Just keep it
about them, keep it moving, and don’t drone on.


Talk about meaning and focus on emotion.


219


### **Do you have a different approach or template when writing** **sales copy to promote a consulting service as opposed to** **promoting a digital product?**

That’s an interesting question because people always want to think,
“My product’s different. My market’s different. My thing is different.
Everything you’re teaching would work for other stuff, but it won’t work
for me.” The first thing to understand is that people are people, and people
buy stuff. Whether you’re selling B2B or B2C or whatever, it’s a person
that’s buying. The person buys on emotion and justifies on logic. They
want to satisfy desires and solve problems. They want to have some fun
and avoid making mistakes.

If I were writing sales copy to promote a consulting service as opposed
to a digital product, I would talk about how they will solve their problem
or satisfy their desire by using the digital product. With the consulting
service, I would talk about how they will fulfill their desire or solve their
problem by hiring the consultant. It’s no different. You explain how they
get what they want. For the digital product, they get it by downloading this
and clicking some buttons. For the consulting service, they get it by getting
on the phone with you, and you solve their problems after a lengthy
interaction.


There’s no different It’s or
approach. problem-agitate-solve
before/after/bridge. Where you are right now, which is the before. The
after of hiring us or getting this digital product, and then positioning the
consulting service or the digital product as the solution. You explain how
they get the benefit. One is a service and one is a download.

### **Does the color of your copy on the page really matter?**


The answer to that is yes and no. Yes, it matters that people can read it
and absorb it, that it doesn’t confuse them, it doesn’t shock them, and it
doesn’t fatigue their eyes. Why do you think most books are black text on
white or cream colored paper? Because that’s the easiest to read. That’s
what we’re used to.

On the flip side, you might hear things like, “Red headlines never
work,” or “Red headlines are the best.” Be careful about prognostications
like it’s always this way or another.

You want your copy on your page neat and orderly with an easy-to-read
color scheme that is pleasing to most people’s eyes. That’s it.


220


I don’t know that the color of your copy matters so much to making
sales, but the color of your text does matter if you want to lose sales. Do
you want to piss people off? Have a navy blue page with canary yellow
writing. I guarantee 99 times out of 100, it will kill your conversions.

### **What do you think about using a good microphone and** **dictation platform like Dragon Naturally Speaking to record** **the copy for version one and then edit?**


Many people can tell their stories but freeze when it’s time to write. In
theory, Dragon Naturally Speaking and other software dictation platforms
like that are a great idea. In practice, they’re a complete and total pain in
the ass (in my opinion). When you dictate using Dragon Naturally
Speaking, you have to remember to say, end of the paragraph, new line,
period, open parentheses, close parentheses, open quote, close quote,
capitalize, new paragraph, all caps, scrap that, and so on. It’s a total pain in
the ass. What happens is you start talking but lose your train of thought.

If you want to dictate something, I suggest you use a service like
Rev.com, where you truly dictate it. Then you send it to a human being
who transcribes it. Rev.com charges $1 per minute. So, if it’s 30-minutes,
it’s a $30 bill. There are other services out there like Dragon Naturally
Speaking on steroids, where they work, but it’s an automated thing, and
they charge 50 cents a minute.

If I want to dictate something short (60 seconds or less), the best
transcription option is to use my iPhone and record a note. For whatever
reason, the iPhone does a better job of transcribing than any other software
I’ve ever used. You can record little snippets this way.

If something is on the top of your mind, you need to capture it. I was on
a Zoom meeting with somebody, talking about creating an email follow up
sequence. I started to say, “You know, the email needs to say . . .” and I
clicked the record button. In 58 seconds, I said what the email should say
and turned off the recording. I sent the recording to Rev, they charged me
a dollar and sent it back. All I did was format it.

I think Dragon Naturally Speaking sucks no matter how much you train
it. Use your iPhone or use Rev.com or a live transcription service, and
you’ll be a lot happier.

### **Passive versus active voice.**


221


Passive voice uses the words is, am, was, were, be, as opposed to active
verbs. I encourage you to investigate it.

### **I help people beat their addiction, but is beat addiction a** **good enough hurdle, or should it be more direct like how to** **stop struggling with alcohol?**


As with anything, when you talk about something like beat addiction,
it’s level one. That’s the buzzword stuff people use. The problem is they’re
used to it. It lets them off the hook. “Yeah, I need to beat my addiction.”
So, now we take that down a level, and we say, “Stop struggling with
alcohol.” That’s more specific and creates more emotion. But you want to
take it to a level three or level four. Talk about destroying your family,
your life in shambles, the financial wreckage, all your money’s gone, you
have no friends, your life sucks, and you’re standing on the edge of a cliff.

Now the question becomes, will you jump, or will you turn around and
do something about it?

Now, please understand that what I just said should not be used in any
way, shape, or form. I’m not giving legal or counseling advice. For God’s
sake, don’t ever tell anybody who’s standing on a cliff they either have to
jump or fix this, because that is a stupid thing to say. This is why I’m not
in any form of counseling. Figuratively, that’s what you have to do. You
have to access those levels of emotion. As you tap into that emotion, using
those emotionally charged words, you will get more sales . . . as opposed
to keeping it at the top level where it doesn’t hurt. In this case, you want it
to hurt. You want pain because real pain spurs them to take action.

### **Can Funnel Scripts work without ClickFunnels™?**


Yes. You can use Funnel Scripts to create copy for anything. You don’t
have to have ClickFunnels™, but we do recommend it.

### **Can Snagit capture a full webpage including scrolling down** **the page to get the entire sales page?**


Yes, it can do that.

### **Could you please go into some more detail about copywriting**


222


### **for skimmers and alternative reading path?**

When people skim, they read your main headline. They probably won’t
look at your video sales letter. They’ll look at your bullets. They’ll look at
your sub-headlines. They’ll probably read your offer with a picture of your
product. They’ll read the P.S. They’ll look for the price. So this all has to
have a logical flow to give the skimmer the gist of your entire offer.

### **Do you ever combine the before/after/bridge and the** **problem-agitate-solve together?**


Sure you could, especially when talking about the before. The before
can be problem-agitate. The after describes what life is like, which is
future pacing. The bridge is your solve which explains the product.

### **How would I go about softening negative fear-based terminal** **outcomes of a violent attack, rape, and death regarding self-** **defense products and still have effective copy, as so many** **paid traffic sources are trying to step away from anything to** **do with violence or fear-based sales?**


I don’t know. The immediate thing that pops into my head is statistics
because people can’t argue with statistics. If you use US government
statistics or something else related, maybe you can build around it and see
if they’ll let you do that.

### **Do you have a list of takeaways that you like?**


The easiest takeaway to use is: “Now, this isn’t for everybody. This is
only for people who are _____.” Then you fill in the blank. That’s the type
of takeaway you want to use. You say, “This is only for people who are
seriously motivated to change their life. We can’t do this forever, so we’re
putting a limit of 50 people on this.” Whatever it is, that’s how you do it.
Don’t over-complicate it or over-think it. Tell them you can’t do this for
everybody.

### **After you launch, what’s a reasonable time frame to deliver**


223


### **the physical product to the customer? If you don’t have it yet** **to ship, have that upfront in the sales copy for sure, but was** **wondering what’s too long for delivery.**

I wouldn’t sell anything until I knew I would have it within a week or
two. Preferably you want to have it in hand. So, just because you write the
sales copy (but don’t have the physical product in inventory yet), doesn’t
mean you run ads to the sales copy and take real orders. That can get you
into problems.

Now, you can set it up to test if people will buy whatever you’re
selling. Set up your whole funnel, run ads and get people to the point
where they click the buy button and think they are about to put in their
credit card. But when they click that last button they see a message that
says, “Hey, we’re temporarily out of stock, but put in your email address
and we’ll put you on the priority notification list to contact you when
we’re in stock.” That’s how you can test whether it’s working or not.
Especially for a physical product, you don’t want to take people’s payment
if you don’t have the product ready to ship. There’s too much that can go

wrong.

# **Conclusion**

I hope you enjoyed it!

My whole purpose in this book is to help you make sales. I have a
damaging admission. This book is a sales book more than a copywriting
book. It is about sales as much, or more, than copywriting because when
you learn sales techniques, you can apply them to the written word and the
spoken word. You learned how to structure sales messages and how to
create a conversation that leads someone to want to take action.

You may be at the end of this book, but hopefully it is _your beginning_ . I
hope I inspired you to want to get better at selling. Becoming good at
selling means getting good at making money. There’s nothing wrong with
helping people while making money. This book also talked about clear
communication with your prospects. You definitely want these three skills
(selling, making money, communicating clearly) to become part of who
you are. It’ll make a huge difference for you in virtually every area of your
life.

Take the secrets in this book, apply them to your copywriting, and
make more sales. Be authentic and help people make a difference in their
lives in the process. That’s a real win-win for everyone.

# **Acknowledgments**

I have to start by thanking my wife, Terri. For listening to my crazy ideas,
managing our household and finances so expertly, and making sure we all
have a stable environment that enables us to do what we do, thank you!

Thank you, Soosan Hall, my trusted right-hand for so many years now.
Nothing I’ve done over the last 15 years would have been possible if you
hadn’t stood there in that tiny office that day so long ago and asked me
“What time do you want me here tomorrow?”

Thanks to Dan Thomas and Dan Roam, the world’s greatest
mastermind partners, for encouraging me (rather forcefully) to write this
book for many years. You guys have pushed me and helped me grow and
I’m forever grateful.

To my “mortgage mom,” Cheryl Morgan, thanks for kicking me out the
door to make sales calls and learn by doing when I would have rather
stayed in the office and messed around with charts and maps.

Thanks to all of the great folks at my very first sales job at Equitable
Life Assurance Society. The late Joel Bernhard, Mike McNulty, Mike and
Ken Mason and all the team. Though I failed miserably at selling
insurance as a twenty-one-year-old, I learned one thing: great salespeople
are the freest, highest paid people on earth.

A special shout out to Steve Powers, one of the finest examples of
personal salesmanship I’ve ever met. Again, though I didn’t set the world
on fire when I worked with you and we haven’t talked in twenty years, you
taught me lessons about selling that have lasted a lifetime.

Thank you, Ray Roenker and Ray Bjorkman, for giving me my chance
in the mortgage business where I had my first real taste of selling success
at the ripe old age of twenty-three. If it hadn’t been for you taking a chance
on me, I wouldn’t be where I am today.

Thank you, Andrew Lacey, one of the top real estate trainers in the
country, for teaching me one of the most powerful sales lessons of my life:
one good sales script delivered well can make you rich.

I want thank the team at Author Academy Elite, Kary, David, and
Kirsten, for helping me pull this project together. Though I have already
self-published dozens of books over the years, I needed extra help pulling
this one together, and you all delivered. This would never have gotten
done without your support and guidance. Thank you!

And finally, I’d like to thank everyone who ever bought (or didn’t buy)
anything from me: a house, life insurance policy, grave plot, weight loss


229


plan, buying club membership, car, radio, cell phone, pizza, mortgage, ebook, software wizard, and more. Whether you bought or not, you helped
me learn more about sales and the words that do and don’t make people
buy. For that, I am eternally grateful.

# **About the Author**

Jim Edwards started his selling career very inauspiciously in the late
1980’s after graduating with a degree in history from The College Of
William and Mary. In his first 18 months out of school, he quit or got fired
from seven different jobs, including selling: trunked radios, cell phones,
insurance, weight loss, and grave plots. It wasn’t until Jim landed in the
mortgage business that he discovered the power of selling people what
they want and being in the right place at the right time with the right sales

message.

In 1997, Jim was one of the first people to sell an e-book online. This
was when he got serious about learning the techniques of direct response
copywriting (salesmanship in print). Because of his e-book sales, Jim
appeared in the _New York Times_, _Entrepreneur Magazine,_ and countless
other online and offline publications around the globe.

In 1998, Jim also started writing “The Net Reporter,” a syndicated
newspaper column that ran for ten years.

Jim has gone on to use his copywriting skills to sell millions of dollars
of his products, services, coaching, and software online. His real passion is
helping non-sales people learn how to sell so they can share their message,
products, and value with the world.

Jim lives in the tiny town of Port Haywood, VA, where he enjoys
raising his chickens, playing with his grandkids, taking his wife fishing,
taking naps with his dog, and going for long runs with a headlamp on dark,
deserted country roads early in the morning.
